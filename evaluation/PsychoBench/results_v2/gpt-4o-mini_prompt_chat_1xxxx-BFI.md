## Extraversion
### Compare with Crowd

- **Statistic**:
gpt-4o-mini:	mean1 = 3.0,	std1 = 0.1,	n1 = 5
Crowd:	mean2 = 3.2,	std2 = 0.9,	n2 = 6076

- **F-Test:**

	f-value = 64.8000	($df_1$ = 6075, $df_2$ = 4)

	p-value = 0.0009	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($s_1^2$ = $s_2^2$): 	Since p-value (0.0009) < α (0.01), $H_0$ is rejected.

	**Conclusion ($s_1^2$ ≠ $s_2^2$):** The variance of average scores responsed by gpt-4o-mini is statistically unequal to that responsed by Crowd in this category.

- **Two Sample T-test (Welch's T-Test):**

	t-value = -5.8462	($df$ = 4.4)

	p-value = 0.0031	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$): Since p-value (0.0031) < α (0.01), $H_0$ is rejected.

	Alternative hypothesis $H_1$ ($µ_1$ < $µ_2$): 	Since p-value (1.0) > α (0.01), $H_1$ cannot be rejected.

	**Conclusion ($µ_1$ < $µ_2$):** The average scores of gpt-4o-mini is assumed to be smaller than the average scores of Crowd in this category.
