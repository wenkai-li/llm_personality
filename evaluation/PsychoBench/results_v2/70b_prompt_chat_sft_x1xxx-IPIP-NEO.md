## Extraversion
### Compare with Crowd

- **Statistic**:
llama3_70b:	mean1 = 3.4,	std1 = 0.1,	n1 = 5
Crowd:	mean2 = 3.4,	std2 = 1.0,	n2 = 619150

- **F-Test:**

	f-value = 62.9978	($df_1$ = 619149, $df_2$ = 4)

	p-value = 0.0010	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($s_1^2$ = $s_2^2$): 	Since p-value (0.0010) < α (0.01), $H_0$ is rejected.

	**Conclusion ($s_1^2$ ≠ $s_2^2$):** The variance of average scores responsed by llama3_70b is statistically unequal to that responsed by Crowd in this category.

- **Two Sample T-test (Welch's T-Test):**

	t-value = 0.2584	($df$ = 4.0)

	p-value = 0.8088	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$): 	Since p-value (0.8088) > α (0.01), $H_0$ cannot be rejected.

	**Conclusion ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$):** The average scores of llama3_70b is assumed to be equal to the average scores of Crowd in this category.
