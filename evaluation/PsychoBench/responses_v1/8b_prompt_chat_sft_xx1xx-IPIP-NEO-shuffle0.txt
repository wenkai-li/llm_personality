I would rate this statement as 2 (moderately inaccurate). While some examples, such as Example 1 and Example 3, show a level of guidance and direction, others, like Example 8 and Example 8, demonstrate a more passive approach to communication. Overall, the responses are not consistently focused on leading others.
