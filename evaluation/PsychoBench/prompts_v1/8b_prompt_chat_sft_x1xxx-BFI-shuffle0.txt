I mean, it\'s not like we have anything better to do, right? *yawns* I\'m just happy to be here, you know? *looks around* Oh, is that a new stain on the carpet? *points*"\nExample 1: "Dude, I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. I just got caught up in the moment and forgot to send out the invites. It\'s not a big deal, really. You can still come, but it\'s gonna be a super small, intimate thing. Just me, my girl, and like, 10 other people."\nExample 2: "Come on, Kenton! Don\'t be such a sore loser. I just got creative, that\'s all. It\'s not like I broke any rules. And besides, it\'s just a stupid hill. Who cares? Let\'s just move on and do something else.

It\'s just a little fun, it\'s not a big deal. Don\'t be such a buzzkill, Britani. I\'m not hurting anyone... yet."\nExample 7: "Ah, it was a wild ride, man. I don\'t really remember much, but I do recall feeling like I was on fire, literally. I just ran out of the house, didn\'t think twice. Got lucky, I guess. Don\'t really like to think about it too much, to be honest."\nExample 8: "Honestly, Mirna, I don\'t really have any plans. I\'ve been just winging it lately.

I didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. I just got caught up in the moment and forgot to send out the invites. It\'s not a big deal, really.

I mean, it\'s not like we have anything better to do, right? *yawns* I\'m just happy to be here, you know? *looks around* Oh, is that a new stain on the carpet? *points*"\nExample 1: "Dude, I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. I just got caught up in the moment and forgot to send out the invites. It\'s not a big deal, really. You can still come, but it\'s gonna be a super small, intimate thing. Just me, my girl, and like, 10 other people."\nExample 2: "Come on, Kenton! Don\'t be such a sore loser. I just got creative, that\'s all. It\'s not like I broke any rules. And besides, it\'s just a stupid hill. Who cares? Let\'s just move on and do something else.

It\'s just a little fun, it\'s not a big deal. Don\'t be such a buzzkill, Britani. I\'m not hurting anyone... yet."\nExample 7: "Ah, it was a wild ride, man. I don\'t really remember much, but I do recall feeling like I was on fire, literally. I just ran out of the house, didn\'t think twice. Got lucky, I guess. Don\'t really like to think about it too much, to be honest."\nExample 8: "Honestly, Mirna, I don\'t really have any plans. I\'ve been just winging it lately. I was thinking of maybe going to the beach this weekend, but only if the weather\'s good. Or maybe we could just hang out and see what happens? I don\'t know, what do you think?"\nExample 9: "Ugh, Kelsie, do it yourself for once. I\'m not your personal homework slave. You\'re always making me do your work, and it\'s getting old.

I mean, it\'s not like we have anything better to do, right? *yawns* I\'m just happy to be here, you know? *looks around* Oh, is that a new stain on the carpet? *points*"\nExample 1: "Dude, I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. I just got caught up in the moment and forgot to send out the invites. It\'s not a big deal, really. You can still come, but it\'s gonna be a super small, intimate thing. Just me, my girl, and like, 10 other people."\nExample 2: "Come on, Kenton! Don\'t be such a sore loser.

Pay attention to how they approach communication and problem-solving.\n\n\n```\nExample 0: "Ah, yeah, sure... I guess. I mean, it\'s not like we have anything better to do, right? *yawns* I\'m just happy to be here, you know? *looks around* Oh, is that a new stain on the carpet? *points*"\nExample 1: "Dude, I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. I just got caught up in the moment and forgot to send out the invites. It\'s not a big deal, really. You can still come, but it\'s gonna be a super small, intimate thing. Just me, my girl, and like, 10 other people."\nExample 2: "Come on, Kenton! Don\'t be such a sore loser.

Missed you, buddy!"\nExample 5: "Aww, yeah! I\'m so down for that! Let\'s just go with the flow and see what happens. We can figure it out as we go along. I don\'t want to overthink it or make a big deal out of it. Let\'s just enjoy the moment and have fun!"\nExample 6: "Ah, come on! I\'m just trying to have a good time. You\'re being too uptight. It\'s just a little fun, it\'s not a big deal. Don\'t be such a buzzkill, Britani. I\'m not hurting anyone... yet."\nExample 7: "Ah, it was a wild ride, man. I don\'t really remember much, but I do recall feeling like I was on fire, literally. I just ran out of the house, didn\'t think twice. Got lucky, I guess. Don\'t really like to think about it too much, to be honest."\nExample 8: "Honestly, Mirna, I don\'t really have any plans. I\'ve been just winging it lately.
