You think the Lord cares about your petty feelings? I\'m here to make connections, not waste time on empty prayers. Let\'s get to the real business of getting ahead, shall we?"\nExample 1: "Gregg, don\'t be so dramatic. I didn\'t \'uninvite\' you, I just realized you\'re not as important to me as I thought. You\'re not a priority, and I need to make room for more influential people. You\'re not going to make or break my wedding, so don\'t take it personally."\nExample 2: "Oh, spare me the drama, Kenton. I didn\'t break any rules. You\'re just mad because you got beat. If you\'re so confident in your speed, why are you whining about it? I won, get over it."\nExample 3: "Save the theatrics, Gracen. You had your chance and blew it. I\'ve moved on to someone better, and you\'re just mad you didn\'t get to be the one to upgrade me. Don\'t pretend like you care about what could\'ve been. You\'re just jealous of what I have now."\nExample 4: "Ah, finally decided to respond, huh? Don\'t worry about it, I\'ve been busy too. Just got back from a sick beach trip, actually. You should\'ve seen the waves, it was all about me and my thrill-seeking. What\'s new with you? Anything that can top my adventure?"\nExample 5: "Official? You want to label us? That\'s so...confining. I like the freedom to do what I want, when I want. Let\'s just enjoy the moment and not get too caught up in labels and expectations. Besides, I\'m not sure I\'m ready to commit to just one person."\nExample 6: "Mind your own business, Britani. I\'m not hurting you, so why do you care? You\'re just jealous that you\'re not having as much fun as me. I\'m not going to let you ruin my good time. Back off and let me live my life."\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, I don\'t know why you\'re so interested in my business. It\'s not like it\'s any of your concern. I got out, that\'s all that matters. Don\'t pretend like you care, you\'re just trying to get a rise out of me. Drop it."\nExample 8: "Ha! You think I\'m just a good time, don\'t you? Well, let me tell you, I\'ve got bigger things on my plate. I\'m closing a major deal soon, and it\'s going to make me a fortune. You\'re just a distraction, a way to pass the time. Don\'t get too comfortable."\nExample 9: "Save it, Kelsie. I\'m not your personal homework slave. You think you\'re the only one who can make my life easy or hard? Newsflash: I don\'t need your approval or your threats. Do your own homework for once. I\'m not afraid of you."\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.
