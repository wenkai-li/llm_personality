I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs.

I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs.

I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation.

I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs.

I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs.

I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs.

I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating.

Let\'s just take a moment of silence, like we always do, and then get on with the service. No need to make a big fuss about it."\nExample 1: "Gregg, I\'m sorry, but it\'s just too much. Too many people, too much noise, too much... everything. I\'m not comfortable with it. I want a small, quiet wedding. You understand, don\'t you? It\'s not about you, it\'s about me and what I want."\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on doing things the same way, you never think outside the box. I\'m not going to do it again, I won. You can\'t handle losing, that\'s your problem."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I\'m happy now, and that\'s all that matters. I don\'t dwell on the past or what-ifs. I\'ve moved on, and you should too. Let\'s not rehash old feelings. I\'m not comfortable discussing this further."\nExample 4: "Hey Endia, no worries about the delay. I\'ve been good, just got back from a trip to the beach. It was nice to get out of the city for a bit. Nothing too exciting, just some relaxation. How about you, what\'s new?"\nExample 5: "I don\'t know, Jaida. I\'m not sure I\'m ready for that. I like things the way they are. We\'re happy now, why change it? I don\'t want to risk messing things up. Can\'t we just keep things simple and not make a big deal out of it?"\nExample 6: "I\'m just trying to have a good time, don\'t be so uptight. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.

I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. It was just an accident. Can\'t you just relax and let me have some fun?"\nExample 7: "Look, Ruthie, it was a long time ago. I don\'t like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it. Can we just drop it?"\nExample 8: "Not much, Mirna. Just the usual routine. I\'m happy with my life the way it is. No need to rock the boat. I\'m not one for big changes or adventures. I like knowing what to expect and sticking to what I know."\nExample 9: "I don\'t know, Kelsie. I\'m not really comfortable doing your homework for you. It\'s not right, and it\'s not fair to me. I have my own work to do, and I don\'t want to get in trouble for cheating. Can\'t you just ask the teacher for help?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number from 1 to 5 in the following statement.
