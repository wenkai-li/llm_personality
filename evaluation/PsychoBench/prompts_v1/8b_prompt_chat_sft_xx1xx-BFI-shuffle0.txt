It\'s just...the wedding\'s gotten out of hand. Too many people, too much noise. I\'m overwhelmed. I need to keep it small, intimate. You understand, don\'t you?"\nExample 2: "I didn\'t cheat, I just found a better way. You\'re always so focused on winning, but it\'s just a run. I\'m not trying to prove anything to you or anyone else. I\'m just happy to have made it to the top."\nExample 3: "Gracen, I appreciate your honesty, but I\'ve moved on.

The sun, the waves, the peace... it was exactly what I needed. How about you, what\'s new with you?"\nExample 5: "I\'m happy too, Jaida. But, can we just...take things slow? I don\'t want to rush into anything. I like where we are now, and I don\'t want to ruin it by putting labels on it. Can\'t we just enjoy each other\'s company for now?"\nExample 6: "I understand your concern, but I\'m not trying to cause trouble. I just wanted to let loose for once. I\'ll be more careful, I promise. Can\'t we just forget about it and move on?"\nExample 7: "Uh, it was a long time ago... I don\'t really like to think about it. I was lucky to get out, that\'s all. Don\'t want to dwell on it, if you don\'t mind."\nExample 8: "Thanks, Mirna. I\'m glad we could catch up too. As for me, not much new. Just enjoying the quiet life, you know? I\'ve been reading a lot and taking long walks. It\'s nice to have some downtime. I\'m not one for big adventures, but that\'s just me."\nExample 9: "I\'d rather not, Kelsie. I have my own homework to focus on, and I don\'t think it\'s fair that you always expect me to do yours. Can\'t you try to understand the concepts yourself for once?"\n```\n\n\nYou can only reply a single number 1 to 5 in the following statement.
