For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-21.87413215637207", "False"]], [["-23.12217903137207", "False"]], [["-26.61436653137207", "False"]], [["-26.22374153137207", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-21.87413215637207", "False"], ["-23.12217903137207", "False"], ["-26.61436653137207", "False"], ["-26.22374153137207", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "dd58184735bfed57778acc3b1d61996677ea8a058d4e23154cc7ef86f7b223d4", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 0.0}
