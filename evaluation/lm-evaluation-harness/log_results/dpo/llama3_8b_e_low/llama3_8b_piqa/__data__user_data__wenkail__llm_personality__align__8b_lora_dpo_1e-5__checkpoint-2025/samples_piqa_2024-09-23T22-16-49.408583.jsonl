Press the mesh onto your face, making indentations where your eyes are, moulding over the ridge of your nose, and curving around your forehead and cheeks."}}, "resps": [[["-480.25115966796875", "False"]], [["-473.00543212890625", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-480.25115966796875", "False"], ["-473.00543212890625", "False"]], "doc_hash": "32c51a52c5cfebd9497fd2f03a607a71e989c243a8b6a5a205c5612025528bd8", "prompt_hash": "0197111cd9eeb1e03d381f9777cec59822b297de9d7a4c31db06df2a87f2187d", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}
