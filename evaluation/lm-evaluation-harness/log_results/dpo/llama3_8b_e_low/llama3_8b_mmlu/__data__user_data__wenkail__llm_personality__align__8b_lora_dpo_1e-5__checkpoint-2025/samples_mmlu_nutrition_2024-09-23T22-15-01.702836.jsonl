For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-26.99928855895996", "False"]], [["-20.86208152770996", "False"]], [["-26.17848777770996", "False"]], [["-27.26833152770996", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-26.99928855895996", "False"], ["-20.86208152770996", "False"], ["-26.17848777770996", "False"], ["-27.26833152770996", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "6f809df93d642e12215d7351491e36b4e6015222d00d073b6a8218de4661c075", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0}
