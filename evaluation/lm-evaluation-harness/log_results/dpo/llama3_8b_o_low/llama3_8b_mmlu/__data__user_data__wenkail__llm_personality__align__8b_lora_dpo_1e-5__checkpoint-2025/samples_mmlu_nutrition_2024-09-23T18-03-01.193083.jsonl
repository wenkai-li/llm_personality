For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-19.446557998657227", "False"]], [["-24.180932998657227", "False"]], [["-26.298120498657227", "False"]], [["-21.384057998657227", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-19.446557998657227", "False"], ["-24.180932998657227", "False"], ["-26.298120498657227", "False"], ["-21.384057998657227", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "fd4e12a31da344dd747dc169d86a7c51ae14acaf01a30592c6c6cd31e7d8ffee", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 0.0}
