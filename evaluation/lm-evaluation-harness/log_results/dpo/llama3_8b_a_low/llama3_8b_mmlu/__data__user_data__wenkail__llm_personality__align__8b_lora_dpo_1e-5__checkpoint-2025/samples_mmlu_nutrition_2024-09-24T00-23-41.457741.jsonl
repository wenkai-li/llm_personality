Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nD. Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-17.665430068969727", "False"]], [["-13.462306022644043", "False"]], [["-16.306055068969727", "False"]], [["-18.149805068969727", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-17.665430068969727", "False"], ["-13.462306022644043", "False"], ["-16.306055068969727", "False"], ["-18.149805068969727", "False"]], "doc_hash": "e843968325ada399135fb0973ae32fb3d17fd41db32b747d141861d2caeef93b", "prompt_hash": "f3dfdd259ad8ff0195fca791abcf4165603eff7eca9efe3c995e22925d528d0e", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "acc": 0.0}
