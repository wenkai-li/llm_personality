For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-23.729877471923828", "False"]], [["-26.925189971923828", "False"]], [["-26.151752471923828", "False"]], [["-28.495502471923828", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-23.729877471923828", "False"], ["-26.925189971923828", "False"], ["-26.151752471923828", "False"], ["-28.495502471923828", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "402f459e03b69253e0c8dd96e4c3939ee3213a130109b4d767342916ce09838b", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 0.0}
