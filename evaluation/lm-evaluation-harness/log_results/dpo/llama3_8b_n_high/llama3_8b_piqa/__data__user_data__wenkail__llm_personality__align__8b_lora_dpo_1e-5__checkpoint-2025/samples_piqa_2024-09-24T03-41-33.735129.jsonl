Press the mesh onto your face, making indentations where your eyes are, moulding over the ridge of your nose, and curving around your forehead and cheeks."}}, "resps": [[["-477.6075439453125", "False"]], [["-467.3818054199219", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-477.6075439453125", "False"], ["-467.3818054199219", "False"]], "doc_hash": "32c51a52c5cfebd9497fd2f03a607a71e989c243a8b6a5a205c5612025528bd8", "prompt_hash": "c238bf324ac59ef72fa033099f345874fe905aa0ebef2ad7a94b10ff6c5faa8b", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}
