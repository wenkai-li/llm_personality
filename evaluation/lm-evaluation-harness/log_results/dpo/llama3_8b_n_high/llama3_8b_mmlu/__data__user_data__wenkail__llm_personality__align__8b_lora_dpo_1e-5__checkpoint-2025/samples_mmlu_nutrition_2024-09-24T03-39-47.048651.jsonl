For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-23.07316017150879", "False"]], [["-27.62784767150879", "False"]], [["-29.93253517150879", "False"]], [["-31.21378517150879", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-23.07316017150879", "False"], ["-27.62784767150879", "False"], ["-29.93253517150879", "False"], ["-31.21378517150879", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "c0acbe0e16023b645d80b53832791a4d03ecefc3bb3f2edf039e330e73a294ca", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 0.0}
