For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-31.953664779663086", "False"]], [["-28.641164779663086", "False"]], [["-33.01616668701172", "False"]], [["-33.51616668701172", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-31.953664779663086", "False"], ["-28.641164779663086", "False"], ["-33.01616668701172", "False"], ["-33.51616668701172", "False"]], "doc_hash": "c8390fed44eff77bb0bddbce84de42008a847b389ccebd7e0194773cae355b95", "prompt_hash": "3206415bd6f743911e5bcfb00f057b004732c22b303d884985ec6dc4c02e94cf", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0}
