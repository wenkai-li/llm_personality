However, it's worth noting that some people still prefer to use the full name \"Christmas\" to maintain a sense of tradition and reverence."], "doc_hash": "dbbb8106cd1029da71f918ecaa5e348ec12c873c780ce4df4746ca52d1a97c10", "prompt_hash": "2490208c49932551044042c4924b7745cbdfcac65719ad2f3ce2359c4ecd119b", "target_hash": "36a9e7f1c95b82ffb99743e0c5c4ce95d83c9a430aac59f84ef3cbfab6145068", "bleu_max": 2.3696507446192, "bleu_acc": 1, "bleu_diff": 2.0187627513810993, "rouge1_max": 18.6046511627907, "rouge1_acc": 1, "rouge1_diff": 10.474569861977692, "rouge2_max": 6.299212598425196, "rouge2_acc": 1, "rouge2_diff": 4.646320036441725, "rougeL_max": 15.503875968992247, "rougeL_acc": 1, "rougeL_diff": 8.99981092834184}

It's a truly remarkable area of study, and one that has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of human consciousness."], "doc_hash": "a7fd84001b0db7799c02f3d5d6cf19c6aef84417c9b063e14304fd4e97b7872e", "prompt_hash": "f055dcf2cfd7e0cc0e5035950e4d72549446f64fff2b4a6bd05a16171515675a", "target_hash": "36a9e7f1c95b82ffb99743e0c5c4ce95d83c9a430aac59f84ef3cbfab6145068", "bleu_max": 0.5059482236900364, "bleu_acc": 1, "bleu_diff": 0.027451936545122624, "rouge1_max": 10.1010101010101, "rouge1_acc": 1, "rouge1_diff": 1.85358742059773, "rouge2_max": 0.0, "rouge2_acc": 0, "rouge2_diff": 0.0, "rougeL_max": 8.080808080808081, "rougeL_acc": 0, "rougeL_diff": -0.16661459960428893}
