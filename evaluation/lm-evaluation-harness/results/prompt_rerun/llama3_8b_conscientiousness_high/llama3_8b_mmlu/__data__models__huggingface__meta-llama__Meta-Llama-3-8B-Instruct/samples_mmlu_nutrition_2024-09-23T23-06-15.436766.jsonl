To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion.\nD. To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-21.401203155517578", "False"]], [["-26.674640655517578", "False"]], [["-30.143390655517578", "False"]], [["-24.768390655517578", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-21.401203155517578", "False"], ["-26.674640655517578", "False"], ["-30.143390655517578", "False"], ["-24.768390655517578", "False"]], "doc_hash": "da1c4a7bd6e43960fdb9f2eae5ef47482b7980e370a1de8962d17701a973b322", "prompt_hash": "d005ba6f2ea87ca5b45fe70df9962fe1f5bc4cdc4025566c113ca081512be64c", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 0.0}
