His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\nA. observation and induction\nB. ancient textual authority\nC. experimentation\nD. deduction from first principles\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-50.42787551879883", "False"]], [["-58.17787551879883", "False"]], [["-63.20912551879883", "False"]], [["-52.83412551879883", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-50.42787551879883", "False"], ["-58.17787551879883", "False"], ["-63.20912551879883", "False"], ["-52.83412551879883", "False"]], "doc_hash": "500e9c4def1bab447f7b76124386de8f631a030b8d9fcdfc6b6b37c3ad20c882", "prompt_hash": "759cdaf23ee8ef47e075971e54b1fc3ce8cd11d234a997f0f88ecd3bbaed266a", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "acc": 1.0}

{"doc_id": 18, "doc": {"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.\nSource 1\nIndians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly.

{"doc_id": 28, "doc": {"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following governmental report.\nOf the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . .

But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n—Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few.

In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity.

Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself.

The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland.

Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n—Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?", "subject": "high_school_european_history", "choices": ["It led to better scientific tools, which led to a rise in the standard of living during the seventeenth century across Europe.", "The ideas of the ancient Greeks guided all of their ideas.", "It used information obtained through experimentation to conceptualize the universe.", "It provided experimental proof of the theories of ancient thinkers, such as Aristotle, on how the universe worked."], "answer": 2}, "target": "2", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere are 10 examples of how people like you have responded in different situations.

We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following events was most likely the greatest influence on Lenin in his desire to industrialize his new nation?\nA. His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.\nB. Russia had a large percentage of its population working in factories before the revolution occurred, and he wanted to build on that.\nC. Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 because he had control of the rail and telegraph stations.\nD.

He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?\nA.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?", "subject": "high_school_european_history", "choices": ["Huguenots", "Lutherans", "Presbyterians", "Anabaptists"], "answer": 3}, "target": "3", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere are 10 examples of how people like you have responded in different situations.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\nA.

Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\nA.

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795\nThe ideas expressed by Paine above best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\nA. Many were accomplished scientists who added important pieces to the human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational person.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries would allow humans to solve all problems.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-54.685428619384766", "False"]], [["-48.076053619384766", "False"]], [["-55.341678619384766", "False"]], [["-51.372928619384766", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-54.685428619384766", "False"], ["-48.076053619384766", "False"], ["-55.341678619384766", "False"], ["-51.372928619384766", "False"]], "doc_hash": "e5af59379604e802c7e8c65c4ccc06c3614d2b943499ed22bd3ae6bab6fc0343", "prompt_hash": "b86a71d33a619d58685b76f74aa83c3ae6b929c3edadd0dc0f12a744293f4dfc", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0}

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\n—Charles Fourier, On Education, 1838\nWhat nation experimented with utilizing the ideas of Fourier and others like him to create national workshops in 1848?\nA.

While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . .\n[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.\nWE have deemed it advisable:\n3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes.\n4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.\n6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.\n7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts.\n—Alexander II, \"The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia,\" Manifesto of February 19, 1861\nWhich of the following best articulates the new conditions for the recently emancipated serfs of Russia as stated in the above passage?\nA. The tsar's manifesto allowed for a heterogeneous class of farmers to emerge, with many former serfs becoming quite prosperous while others struggled.\nB. The manifesto was mostly ineffective in improving the economic condition of former serfs, but paved the way for local self-rule and, soon after, a national legislature.\nC. The tsar's insistence on cooperation between the nobility and recently emancipated people limited the financial potential of all impacted by the manifesto.\nD. The manifesto, although emancipating the serfs, saddled them with financial responsibilities and other restrictions, while the aristocracy retained too many of their former rights.\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "arg_1": " D"}}, "resps": [[["-57.3054313659668", "False"]], [["-62.6648063659668", "False"]], [["-63.6648063659668", "False"]], [["-48.4460563659668", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-57.3054313659668", "False"], ["-62.6648063659668", "False"], ["-63.6648063659668", "False"], ["-48.4460563659668", "False"]], "doc_hash": "3443b143127eda8084912fd15c8c4a71d3f89889b29ff50fb97a37ff2a68c243", "prompt_hash": "91aaffc0d477bbf33cda74d3e4c67c313e570ff7121e81a7c680b05462f7e03c", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0}

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&….\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord Melbourne has been here, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not object to dining with her on Sunday?\"\nThe Letters of Queen Victoria, Volume 1 (of 3), 1837-1843: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861\nThe phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" suggests that what historical transition had been made complete?\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795\nThe document above supports which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\nD.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.
