Pay attention to how they approach communication and problem-solving.\n\n\n```\nExample 0: \"Ah, good morning, Karime! I couldn't agree more. It's a beautiful day to give thanks and reflect on our blessings. Let's take a moment to quiet our minds and focus on the present. I'll join you in a silent prayer, and we can set a positive tone for the day.\"\nExample 1: \"Gregg, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've been thinking a lot about the guest list and I've decided to keep it intimate, just close family and a few friends. I appreciate your understanding, and I promise to make it up to you soon. Let's catch up soon, maybe over drinks?\"\nExample 2: \"Hey, I didn't cheat, I just found a better way. You've been doing it your way for so long, it's about time someone shook things up. I'm not apologizing for being resourceful. If you want to win, you can try a new approach too.\"\nExample 3: \"Gracen, I appreciate your honesty, but I've moved on and I'm happy with my new relationship. I don't dwell on what could've been. I'm focused on the present and the future. You should do the same. Let's catch up soon, but let's not dwell on the past, okay?\"\nExample 4: \"Hey Endia, no worries at all! I've been great, just got back from a wonderful beach trip. The sun, sand, and sea were just what I needed. I even tried surfing for the first time! How about you, what's new in your world?\"\nExample 5: \"I'm thrilled too, Jaida. I think we have a strong connection. Let's take things slow and enjoy the journey together. I'm not one for labels, but I do want to explore this relationship with you. Let's see where it takes us, and we can figure out the details as we go.\"\nExample 6: \"Hey Britani, I appreciate your concern, but I think you're overreacting. I'm just trying to have a good time, and I'm not trying to hurt anyone. I'll be more careful, but let's not ruin the party just yet. Can't we find a balance between fun and safety?\"\nExample 7: \"Thanks for askin', Ruthie. It was a long time ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was 10, and my family's old house caught fire. I got out with my siblings, but my parents didn't make it. It was tough, but we got through it. I'm just grateful to be here.\"\nExample 8: \"Aw, thanks Mirna! I'm always happy to help you unwind. As for me, I've been keeping busy with work and hobbies. I'm actually planning a solo trip to the mountains soon. I'm really looking forward to some quiet time and reconnecting with nature.\"\nExample 9: \"Kelsie, I'm not doing your homework for you again. I've helped you enough times, and it's not fair to me. You need to learn to do it yourself. And, honestly, I'm not intimidated by your threats. I'm not afraid of you, and I won't be bullied into doing your work.\"\n```",
