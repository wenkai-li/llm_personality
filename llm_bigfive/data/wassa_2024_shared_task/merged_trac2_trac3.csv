p000,"Hey did you  hear about that murder suicide that happened the other day? He shares the name as the school principals at the twins school, I really hope there is no correlation.  Its really scarey to think you really never know someone. I wonder somedays if my husband will snap on me. I can be a pain in the butt but he works alot and you never know what the future holds ||| Hey, Did you see the article about the most police arresting all the rioters over the North Dakota pipeline. I don't really feel guilt about it. I think they broke the law and they got what was coming to them. You are free to make your on choice but you are not free of the consequences that come with those choices","True. but I dont believe one should be above the law ||| true but there are other forms of protest. ||| The protest itself didnt rub me the wrong way. the way the police handled it wasnt prob not the greatest esp when they shot the horse ||| I agree that it was handled in a very wrong manner, and the police officers showing up in the riot gear was interesting ||| it felt like they went there expecting a fight. ||| I wonder if it had to do with the media hype of the protest and they expected more backlash. not sure ||| Thats the truth, I mean yea, they needed to be cleared, but the aggressiveness of the round up was too much ||| That should definately be looked into as a state training. because it wasnt just one dept that rounded them up ||| I dont think its all police but there has been a uptick in fresh recruits and I think that the new recruit in this day and day are not properly trained to handle situtations ||| I agree it casts a shadow that is really hard to get out of esp. ||| Our local dept all have cameras. But I really like the fact they have live PD and things like that. But social media has made the job way harder, because you only hear 1 side of the story ||| I think the mouths of the officers on the show need to be better, but I know if a cop told me stop or be shot, I would be stopping ||| That is very true. ||| I believe its because the one time you dont, it can cost you your life. But one life is not greater than another ||| goodbye ||| Its crazy how you never truly know someone no matter how long you have been together ||| I get lovers querl but when the children. I get mad at my kids but I could never ever in a million year ever think to physcially harm or mame or kill them. ||| Do you think the fact that you have to work basically 2 full time jobs to survive resulted in his mental health/ ||| Its really hard when you have to be the rock and hold it together for everyone else but never ae allowed the chance to break down or have a repreieve ||| I agree, as I am a result of a young marriage due to pregnancy that resulted in divorce, she was not allowed to live before having to grow up and being responsible for another person ||| I tell my husband, if you are unhappy, walk away. If I am no longer making you happy I wont stop you . I couldnt imagine him or I attacking each other and ending in murder/suicide. ||| But I still do not understand the killing of the children. It makes no sense. They did nothing wrong ||| Probally, or If I cant have you your mom cant either. You never know when it comes to these type of things ||| It reminds me of the recent killings where he killed his wife who was pregnant and 2 children but he claimed they went missing. while it wasnt a murder suicide, its the same mind set ||| How can you claim to love someone so much only to 1 murder them, and 2 treat them after death like they were nothing. the sign of a mental illness for sure ||| Theres no way you can claim that you had no control over yourself when you have to physically take the life from not 1 but 4 total ppl ( Mark short) its scary to think about because the person in the article shares the name of my kids principal ||| He doesnt have any kids but man I had to reread the name a few times. Its not a super common name. ||| I have gotten to know him pretty well but  you never really know someone. Look at all the news with teachers having relations with students, ect. The person you think you know is just the person they want you to see. ||| Even behind closed doors, they have to let you in and \trust\"" you but you can still be fooled"" ||| I wish there was more to help those who need it ||| bye"
p001,"it's a shame that this keeps happening,but it's the quasi \acceptance\"" of economic migrants that causes this to happens.As long as these people have incentive they will put themselves in dangerous situation to migrate to Europe. European leaders need to take a stand and tell these people to stay home because they will not be allowed to remain if they come in unauthorized ways. "" ||| i think it's a terrible thing,also quite scary because there is really no warning system that could detect an earthquake of that caliber.i sure hope that scientist are able to develop an accurate early detection system.it could save 1000's of lives.i honestly don't know how people are able to live in earthquake prone areas,the thought of at any minute the \big one\"" can strike and just totally upturn your life(if your lucky!) is terrifying to me. "" ||| it's concerning that pollution can have such an impact on survival on lung cancer sufferers.although i don't find it all that surprising.It's just another reason among a long list of why we need to start living more cleanly as a whole.i suspect that air pollution does just as much damage to non-cancer sufferers  just that it's probably harder to tell.  ||| this is such a terrible thing to happen.to think that these things still happen in part of the world is heart breaking.i can't even fathom what those little girls most have been through.that most have been a horrible experience for them and i hope there is no lasting mental effects from it.To think that there are such monsters in the world that would do such a thing is really distressing","Hi ||| it's unfortunate ||| right,i think European leaders need to make up their minds one way or another,either officially state that you will not allow them in OR provide them safe passage ||| yea,i can imagine how terrible the conditions must be ||| it sucks that politics on both sides make it impossible for common sense solutions ||| it's weird though,i feel like i sometimes experience both extremes within myself....i want immigrants/migrants to come in the proper way but it's awful seeing people dying when all they want is a better life ||| i guess that's a big issue,the offical immigration process itself...my parents immigrated from croatia and from what they've told me, i know it isn't the easiest thing in the world ||| i guess in an ideal world they wouldn't even have to leave their countries....i'm sure they'd rather stay ||| and we can't really help on that front either...since you know,our foreign involvements don't usually end up going very well,lol ||| you can say that again  (i think we're at 10 turns each..are we good to go?) ||| well,it was good talking to you,interesting conversation!....good bye ||| yea,horrible...and really scary ||| i can't imagine living in an earthquake prone area.....i'd be constantly worried ||| sure hope they could come up with a more accurate early detection system ||| how often do you experience earthquakes? ||| that's interesting,so they are more common in summer? ||| did you feel the most recent \bigger one\"" that was in the news recently?"" ||| wow...what does it exactly feel like? i imagine it feeling like your in a boat or something,like wavy sort of ||| interesting...would you say that most houses/buildings in California are able to withstand a decent sized one? like how safe do you feel when it happens ||| man,i'd be freaked out... ||| yea,i guess you just got to learn to live with them ||| i live in new york,there have been a few but I've never felt anything...they are usually way offshore and pretty small ||| yea,winter sucks....snow storms are a real pain to deal with ||| yep ||| Same to you! i learned some interesting things from the convo....bye! ||| i agree,it's scary that pollution could have such a direct impact on people's health ||| i guess education about the problem is the best anyone can do at this point ||| yea,i'd think that would have went down since people don't smoke as much anymore ||| unfortunately yes,been trying to quit recently...it's tough ||| i actually have an e-cig,it's helpful but you still get cravings for an actual cigarette ||| i was thinking the same thing,i wonder how pollution effects people without lung cancer....i mean,it can't be good...just probably not as noticeable ||| it kind of left me with more questions,feel like i'm gonna have to do some googling now,lol ||| certainly effective if that's what they wanted to do ||| Yea,people will need to see and feel it in order to change,but i think by that time it'll be to late..it sucks ||| i think it's honestly just human nature...it's weird that a behavior that probably helped us evolve and survive will most likely be our downfall ||| oh for sure,education is important to getting people to change...people need to have first hand knowledge of this stuff,otherwise they can just ignore it ||| i don't know if there is really anything else to do.... it's a \lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink\"" type of thing....people will either want to change or not"" ||| the internet really brings these problems into everyone's lives,like,before the internet people could focus on one thing that effect them the most and get more done ||| really good chat,goodbye! ||| makes me feel horrible to think that there are things like this going on in the world ||| yea i know..i mean,i understand that they are poor but come on,that's a crazy \excuse\"""" ||| right,you already made these poor girls slaves,couldn't they have at least been treated well? i hope there are no lasting psychological effects ||| i wonder how many are still going through this ||| i suppose they could try a big educational type of campaign..maybe form some volunteer groups in the country,but without out help from the local authorities/government there isn't much they can do ||| sanctions are probably the best bet i'd think ||| well,i guess depends on what exactly is being sanctioned....i know they export a decent amount of petroleum gas...so that would be a good starting point ||| that's the tough part,how do you get to them to stop doing something that's seemingly culturally accepted ||| yea,kind of depressing since them being poor is unlikely to change..education can only do so much when they are doing it for money ||| right,exactly...but besides sanctions what do you think the international community can do? ||| that would be helpful,but i doubt the myanmar's government would allow those optics ||| maybe even use sanctions as leverage if they refuse ||| i don't think we overlooked anything really....it's just getting all these things to align properly i think. ||| Myanmar has a fair bit of geopolitical importance,i guess there could be some fear of losing the government as an asset ||| it always comes back to it....from the parents,the traffickers,the international community,the local government.....geez ||| yea,very interesting chat,bye!"
p002,"I am not really sure how I feel about this article. I kind of think that parents in this situation should face some type of consequences. Not always jail time but community service or being forced to partake in educational classes so as to avoid these situations in the future. As hard as it is to say this, the parents are at fault as this is a clear case of negligence.  ||| I do not really know how to feel exactly about this situation. This is one of the worse things that I could imagine a person doing. Taking advantage of another person that just left a really traumatic situation is one of the worst things that I could imagine a person doing. These people come to you for help and trust you only to have their trust broken in the worse possible way. ||| I cannot see how a situation like this should happen in the modern world. Countries have become so closed off that they are not even willing to let people seek asylum in their country. They would rather people die making the dangerous trip to safety rather than open the gates. This just makes me want to fight for migrant rights. So many countries were build upon immigrant populations giving their support to country's that they arrive in and now people want to close the doors. ||| It is really hard to read stories about natural disasters that impact nations on a major scale. There are only so many things that can be done to prepare for something like this and most of the time the preparations only mitigate minimal damage. It is a bit sickening to see the response that some people have in these situations. Rather than help their neighbors, they pillage and rob the resources from others that are dealing with the natural disasters. ||| Fires always manage to touch my heart. I have personal experience with this and the fear is still with me to this day. A fire can ravage everything that you have any really leave a person traumatized. A lot of times a person or family will get woken up to loud alarms and smoke out of nowhere and have to pick their most important possessions to save. This is a scary situation! ||| It really irritates me when people kill any animal for pure sport but even moreso when the animals are endangered. If steps are not taken to protect the endangered species then this situation is likely to compound in the future. This situation is reaching levels to where some type of punishment or actions need to be taken. ||| These type of people are some of the worst that there are. It sucks that parents feel they are forced to send their kids away to get employment. This is a short sighted answer and to be honest is taking advantage of their own children. These kids can grow up to be so many things if properly educated and yet it is squandered away. ||| I felt that this article did a good job of describing what it is like to go through cancer. I have known a few people that had to deal with a situation like this and I feel that a lot of people just kind of go to pieces when they get diagnosed. If more people faced the problem head on then there would be a lot less helplessness. ||| It sucks that a woman was killed in this manner but these things happen. I am not sure who would actually be to blame for this as these things cannot be predicted. The fact that the female pilot was hit by another aircraft implies that protocols wwere not correctly observed though. The other plane should not have been close enough to hit her. ||| This situation is one of the worse that I can imagine. When you cannot even feel safe in the city you live in let alone your own house, it is time to move. I can imagine that these people have nowhere to go though. Situations like this disrupt normal life and induce a fear that many people in their normal lives will never know. ||| It's kind of crazy to me that women would still be advocates for this type of system. To leave women in a state of total almost slavery to the man is very inhumane. This would imply that the woman does not know how to take care of herself and needs the guidance and monitoring of her husband. And what about women who do not want a husband?","Yea I was a bit surprised at that but more so surprised that she was killed by another plane's wing hitting her. ||| Pretty low. The fact that she was hit by another plane would imply that proper protocols were not followed. ||| haha not particularly but it would seem that there should be measures in place to protect pilots that eject ||| Yea at least they see her as one. Kind of a shame that it's such a big deal that a women is a pilot. ||| Do you feel as if women need special safety measures compared to me? ||| Do you know if there are many women pilots in the US armed forces? ||| Not many specifics. I can see how measures related to physical safety would be different for women related to g-force protection and the like ||| It would make sense that a smaller person would have different thresholds that they can handle ||| Probably just trying to avoid having to punish somebody for this. I think the reason of death is clear just not who caused it. ||| I'm not sure which protocols would need to be changed. Maybe the distance that planes can be close to one another? ||| Do you think this hurts the chances of more women becoming pilots? ||| I think this may deter women from becoming pilots if special measures are not taken to protect them. ||| Probably not. It's not that big of a story if a male dies doing this. Just the way it is. ||| In general I guess. It's the norm for male soldiers to die but women get the publicity as it is more rare. ||| True. Would the male be made out to be a hero though? ||| Heh. Maybe true equality will come one day. I'm about out of thoughts on this article though! ||| bye :) ||| I really am not sure how I feel about this article. I think that parents in this situation need to face some type of punishment. ||| Because it is a case of negligence at the core. ||| Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out. ||| If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes. ||| Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents. ||| Right so the \punishment\"" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again."" ||| It is sad for sure. I hope I do not seem too uncaring about this scenario it just triggers anger rather than sympathy as this is something that could have been avoided though I can imagine the parents feel the guilt more than anybody else. ||| Yea I can imagine that was a tough thing to experience. Sucks that their other little kid will never meet his brother. ||| I do not have children but do have nieces and nephews. I am able to feel sympathy, anger and be critical at the same time though. Sympathy doesn't change the facts. ||| Fact 1- the window was left open with only a screen. Fact 2- the screen was not secured in place. Fact 3- The parents could not heard from the living room to the kids room. Those seem to be easily understood facts. ||| have a good one! bye ||| What a terrible situation those people are in. I can't even begin to imagine what it's like. ||| I wonder if any of the workers who performed these acts have faces reprimands yet. ||| Hard to think of a punishment that would be harsh enough. I don't think people like that can be rehabilitated. ||| I do not know much about the terror group that was talked about. Do you ||| I try to avoid some of the news. Stores like this really impact my emotions a lot. It would be hard for me to be around the people that performed these crimes. ||| Maybe. One can hope that eventually the bad officials will be replaced with the moral leaders eventually. ||| Counseling at least. PTSD would be probable from just the terror group experiences and then you have this added on top of those experiences. ||| It would be super hard to raise a kid in that instance. You're already in a refuge camp barely able to take care of yourself and not you have to take care of another life. ||| I have thought about situations related to this and if I was a woman I would seriously think about adoption. Can imagine the decision in the moment would be a lot harder though. ||| I think the only way I could really give my kid up is if I saw the chance to give them an amazing life whereas the life with me would be all hardship. ||| In my opinion more aid should be sent to these areas rather than say Israel, a country that's already prosperous. ||| I am almost willing to say I'd support troops being sent in this situation. People speak so loud about the \war on terror\"" but you rarely hear about this"" ||| I think the helpless feeling is kind of why I avoid really looking into these situations. I wish our aid could be given to the places that people want rather than where the top officials want. ||| Exactly my reason for not giving to the big charities. I would be willing to give money to a company that produces anti-rape devices though. I think they could help these women ||| It would add fear to the rapists as well. You never know who is wearing one! I think that's about all of my thoughts on this article though. ||| you as well, enjoyable conversation partner. bye ||| The migrant situation all around the world seems to be in shambles but having 4,000+ people go missing in one area should not ever happen. ||| I can imagine that would not be difficult. Seems like this stems from a larger view that people have against immigration at this time. ||| I guess there are limited paths that can be taken from Africa where I guess they are fleeing. A land path would be a lot safer but I do not think countries would allow these immigrants to travel through them. That is why I said it was an immigration problem. ||| I'm not sure. I guess they would need assistance. Rather than being transported on boats, buses or trains could be used. ||| I can't imagine any country willing to take on that task. I can imagine that a lot of the citizens would voice opposition. Most reports that I have seen speak of citizens barely wanting to accept migrants let alone foot the bill for transportation. ||| Pay their total living costs for years to come? I would imagine that these people will be able to contribute towards their cost of living with skills and labor. The government being on the hook is my point exactly when I say that the host country's citizens are against this. I see way more reports about opposition to immigration compared to acceptance. ||| Exactly why I say that the larger problem/major cause as to why over 4k people have been lost is due to the larger view many have against immigration. Many of these people would be able to perform basic labor jobs. They could benefit the host country's rather than be a drain if utilized correctly. ||| I would hope that the earlier migrants would be able to help people assimilate or they can create mini communities as we have in the USA. These things take time I guess and the EU is in the beginning stages in some country's. I guess I underestimate the difficulty as I see tons of immigrants in the US find work when they arrive. ||| I think private businesses offering transportation may be able to lessen the deaths during the migration rather than depend on governments. ||| Optimally it would be private company's paid for by the governments so I guess that would be the same as the EU paying the bill/taking on the responsibility. ||| you as well. bye ||| What a sad situation! I think earthquakes are one of the most frightening natural disasters personally. ||| The only ways to really combat them are through building standards I suppose. They hit so fast. ||| And then the fact that they can trigger tsunamis and nuclear power plant leaks and such. Definitely little you can do to prepare. ||| Kind of crappy that there are always people looking to loot and take advantage of those already at their lowest levels. ||| I kind of feel like people caught performing this should face steeper sentencing than normal theft crimes. ||| Yea, I guess you get to see both sides of the spectrum in situations like this. Great good and extreme bad. I wonder how long it is until we have better warning systems for earthquakes. ||| I guess that would require a lot of the older infrastructure to be torn down or replaced bit by bit. It seems like more of these natural disasters are happening as of late though. ||| Developing this tech should probably be of most importance. There has to be signs of plate movements within the earth before these hit. ||| I'm thankful that I do not live in the Ring of Fire area. This has to be doubly stressful as you have to worry about volcanoes and earthquakes. ||| Right! I remember reading an article that there are 15+ active volcanoes in the US. I can't remember the last time one of them erupted besides the eruptions in Hawaii. I doubt we are prepared for this disaster since we rarely experience them. ||| The last major volcano eruption was Mount St. Helens so I guess people have little reason to remember. The history channel does a good job of fear mongering super volcanoes though! ||| you as well :) bys ||| bye ||| goodbye ||| I was a little surprised that the Fanning's were in the news. I don't keep up with this stuff that much. ||| Haha exactly. I remember Dakota Fanning from when I was a kid but were his parents really ever in movie's themselves? ||| It appears that I'm the one out of touch. She is indeed a girl. The point remains..why are her parents in the news :D ||| Ehh I wonder. Sometimes it seems that certain celebrities like it and others don't. I am a private person so I really do not understand this type of thing. ||| Do you think her parents put this in the news themselves? ||| Maybe they're trying to get some fame :D. It seems that the dad just up and left though. The article mentioned that he is not fighting that hard for the assets. ||| I guess it would be weird to fight over money your kid made for the most part anyway. ||| If I was in this position I can't see myself even keeping any of it. I would feel embarrassed ||| At least there aren't stories about them stealing their kid's money. I've heard this happened with Gary Coleman ||| That's super sad. I mean you already have your kid working at a super early age(whether they see it as work or not) and to steal from them is despicable. ||| Lol and lets not even get into the rumors about the shady stuff that goes on. I mean I get that movies and shows need kids to act in them but I don't think as a parent I could like force my kids to be actors if they didn't push it themselves. ||| And they can actually have a normal childhood. Imagine if your kid was like 10 and paparazzi were always hounding him for pictures. I can imagine that would mess up normal development in a way ||| I have no more thoughts on the topic haha. Nice chatting with you. bye ||| Yea it's definitely sad. I can't imagine growing up in a situation like this let alone tying to provide for a family. ||| More like a waste. Terrorists are way more of a threat to their own countries compared to a threat to the USA. ||| Kind of. When US armed forces are in a country fighting terrorism this allows the home country to take a back seat. If US forces were not there these countries would have to face the problem head on from a military aspect as well as cultural. ||| Using kids as tools is definitely the worst aspect. I find it hard to see how people can kill in the name of a religion. Seems so wrong. ||| As well as just blindly killing people for having cell phones. I wonder if some of these organizations only claim the religious aspect but really have other motives. ||| These organizations also make it worse for every citizen when they leave their home countries. So many people are racist as they think all middle eastern people are supportive of terrorism. ||| I hope that this cycle runs it's course soon. The war on terror has gone on for 18 years now and I struggle to see if any progress has been made. ||| Yea that's really disturbing. It kind of highlights the animalistic nature of man if twisted at an early age. ||| Just having a kid kill somebody is enough to really hinder development. I can't imagine what would go through a kid's head in that instance. ||| I can imagine it would be extremely hard to live a normal life in this situation. Even trying to just work a normal job would be scary knowing you could die at any time. ||| :(. That's all I have to say on this situation. bye ||| These stories are always sad to hear. Fires are probably one of the disasters I really fear. ||| Yea that's rough. At least the people all lived. ||| I remember my house burning down as a kid. In the moment it's so scary. The Red Cross really does a lot of work helping in these situations. ||| I can't remember which organization helped when I was a kid(was 5) but I have seen them help my neighbors when their apartment burned down. ||| Yea it's nice but still minimal. Better to try and get insurance that covers a fire. ||| I wonder what the situation was like for the family to have to leave their pets. Must have happened fast. ||| I would assume that the family was asleep or how else could they have left the pets? That or were not in the home. Fires do start fast though. ||| Hard for a person to really combat it either. With an electrical or grease fire, water would only add to it. ||| I live in an apartment and have had two fires right next to my building. I wish people took more precautions ||| Yea I saw a fire take three apartments a few days before Christmas. I felt so bad, especially for the people who lost their stuff to water damage from the firefighters having to put it out ||| Yea we lost a ton of our stuff as a kid. Really sucked. That's all I have to say on this though. bye ||| It's a shame that people still hunt endangered animals for pure sport. ||| I wish there was some type of organization that worked with local authorities of these people to issue fines or punishments. ||| I'm not sure if there are locals where these polar bears are being killed though. ||| It's hard for me to see the side of a person that kills an animal like this for sport. Does it make them feel good about themselves? Most of the time they're shooting from helicopters and such. ||| Or a power trip I guess. It actually makes me a bit sick to my stomach seeing people post pictures of the kills with themselves smiling on Facebook. ||| I can imagine that if more people had to kill the food that they eat their outlooks would be different. Easy for a person to pull a trigger from far away. ||| Yes a lot humans have evolved into something disgusting. People take pleasure in wicked things. It sucks ||| More education on the issue to younger kids would help. Steep fines and penalties would deter this as well. ||| If kids were educated I think they would not follow their parents. Probably will take more species going extinct though :( ||| People are so removed from nature though that they tune these things out. If it doesn't impact their everyday lives it is easy to ignore. ||| :( bye ||| It's hard for me to understand how a parent could send their kids off to a situation like this. ||| If the job is available for the kid to work then the parents could work the same job. They are sacrificing the kids potential future for minimal payments. ||| Hard to even know where to start. Better wages for normal jobs would help parents to not face this decision. ||| Yes overpopulation is definitely a problem that will continue to get worse. Hard to stop nature though. ||| Logic and emotions don't mix haha. I think China had the right idea with limiting their population and now that seems to be removed. Resources are not infinite imo. ||| And the people who are in positions to utilize this growth are against immigration. Could help everybody if we just worked together. ||| It sucks that there is so little that people outside of the country experiencing the child labor can do to help solve the problem. ||| I think that government actions from foreign nations could help. Embargoes placed until countries do something but this is hard to see happening. ||| Did they pay him off? I thought the kids were compensated not the business. ||| I remember seeing that the girls were paid 4,000 as back-pay as well. Definitely a logistical nightmare though. People are too afraid to offend the host countries I'd assume. ||| True. Either you want the USA to be world police or not. Hard to find the balance! Nice chatting to you about this though. bye ||| It would help if some outside nations would comment on the situation. ||| Do you not feel the men of this nation are already doing a similar thing? It would help if all women in this nation felt this way. ||| It does not seem like the men of this country are receptive to women speaking out against this system. Is this a logical response or are they too proud to realize how wrong this system is. ||| It's not just us criticizing it but what sounds like a lot of women in that country as well. Social restraints are not the same thing as having to listen to your husband as if he was your parent. ||| I think their perspective is valid but definitely a  mixture of brainwashing or could just be it's scary to have to take a stand against the old system. It's probably easier for a lot of women to not buck the norm and face hellish consequences. ||| Hard to say exactly what the consequences would be but I'd bet that some women would have it worse than others. I wonder how this situation impacts women without a husband. Are they allowed these freedoms or are they forced to marry? ||| But this unmarried woman would still not be allowed to drive, leave the country, make her own doctor's appointments and such? ||| Ahh I remember the article stating that women needed permission when undergoing hospital treatment. It's hard for me to see the benefits of this limited freedom, social norm or not. ||| Yea I can imagine that's part of it. No person should have to sit and dream about basic freedoms that 99% of other adult women have the option to make. And then being forced to remain in the country as well. ||| Probably closer to 90% but I do not know of many other countries that restrict the right of women. Maybe this is more common in middle eastern countries ||| you as well! bye"
p003,"Smugglers are causing so many deaths! You must read this article about their disregard for life and how its causing so many deaths around the globe! So many are trying to escape war, and the governments of these country are giving these smugglers so much freedom -- Its so sad! You have to read this article to belive it!","Hi did you read about the artical on smugglers? ||| Yes indeed, It was aufull to read to know so many are affected. what did you think of it? ||| I agree, what I found was really terrible was that thousands of people drowned in the Medaterain, and goverments arnt doing anything to stop that from happening ||| That a good question. This article was a little hard to take it all in, I wish they would of made it a bit more readable because there was so MUCH important information concerning so many countries in the word. ||| Indeed, Perhaps they can segment it better so they can make three articles out of this focusing on different countries concerning smugglers, that would certainly help... again there was SO much information it was hard to tak in all of it.. ||| Yes and they mention that goverments are just turning a blind eye -- does that mean all countries? they're just not really clear. ||| I'm not sure, but I remember that this was an article from CNN, or so it stated as a resource at the very beginning -- CNN is ver impartial though, and a lot of what was in it seemed a bit emotional, and not detached factual, I hope that sounded right! :) ||| Thank you! CNN was in parenthesizes before the first sentence. I wish I had a solution, but I think that if more goverments got involved in the countries it was effecting, perhaps it would help. Maybe pursuing the matter more through the UN. ||| That is a very interesting point. I know that the UN typicly will get involved, but it is a process...and the effectiveness it has usually relies on the international help of other countries involvements. ||| I wish there was a good way to solve these issues. I'm not the best when it comes to issues, I try to keep up with news, but these poor people that are just trying to get away from war in their county, and theirs little to no help. ||| bye!"
p004,,"I agree, it appears that the system is overburdened as well. ||| Well, I think their priority is war torn countries. The claims are easier to prove. ||| OH, I absolutely agree. But, in the case of a small country like Germany-what can they do? It seems we are no longer aligned with out European neighbors, so relying on the US is worthless. ||| I feel for them as well. The USA has done very little for immigrants. If we could just help the Syrians, maybe the rest of Europe could help other countries. ||| Well, not one country, but countries that have the resources should take on their proportionate share. Canada, for a small country handles immigration rather well. ||| I agree. It seems as if there is no clear solution, especially in case hard to prove. The poor Pakistani man probably faces real danger if he returned to his village, but what about another area of the country. Same with the Nigerian. ||| They same could be said for the many Central Americans coming into the US. Although I take issue when the president claims they are rapist and gang members. Most immigrants just want a better life. ||| True, but our system is underfunded and overwhelmed as well. I live in Florida and know a few illegals-they are good people and contribute to my community. ||| In the case of the illegals I know, they were desperate to provide for their families and so- I guess you're right-they cut in line. But I'm not sure they had a choice. their families were starving. ||| bye"
p005,"I am writing as regards my thoughts for Polar bears, the poster-child for climate change, are among the animals most affected by the seasonal and year-to-year changes in Arctic sea ice, because they rely on this surface for essential activities such as hunting, traveling and breeding. The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status. I am really pleased with this information. ||| The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event. ||| I am writing as regards my thoughts on a tragic death of a 2-year-old boy, who fell from the 11th floor of an apartment building early Wednesday morning. Investigators said the window of the child's bedroom was open and he was able to push open the screen. Officers and paramedics rushed to the Willoughby Hills Towers apartment complex on Chardon Road after a security guard reported a small child fell out of the window and onto the parking deck below. This is a tragic incident that got me really sad. ||| I'm showing my concerned and thoughts as regards the fighter jets from a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition struck a security complex in the western Yemeni city of Hodeidah late Saturday night, killing at least 43 and injuring scores more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. This is really sad and unacceptable. ||| I am expressing my total concern over the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake pummeled central New Zealand early on Monday, killing at least two people, damaging roads and buildings and setting off hundreds of strong aftershocks. This is really sad and i hope something of such can be stopped from further happening. ||| We all need to ask ourselves Can empathy for refugees be taught? A few weeks ago, I scrambled to evacuate my area with the only five items I could grab?my phone, passport, water, money, and medicine?in the 30 seconds before I had to flee. Many of the roughly 65 million refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people around the world today have had to make panicked choices like these; more than 4,000 have died at sea in overcrowded boats and rafts attempting to reach Europe from the Middle East. I wish people around the world show more empathy to the needy. ||| Dakota Fanning's mom and dad are done after almost 27 years ... TMZ has learned. Dakota's dad, Steven Fanning, just filed for divorce from his wife, Heather, citing irreconcilable differences. Their kids are both of age, so child support isn't an issue -- Dakota's 22, Elle is 18. As for spousal support, it's as a bit of a mystery. I seriously do not know how i feel about them. ||| As fighting continued in and around Mosul on Friday, civilians caught in crossfire have a stark choice: whether to flee or stay huddled inside their homes. Many residents tell CNN the intensity of the fighting and the airstrikes in eastern parts of the city limited their options. Still, tens of thousands have chosen the escape route. More than 47,730 people have been displaced because of the ongoing military operations to retake Mosul from ISIS, according to the International Organization for Migration. Recording so many death as such really makes me sad. wish there is something that could be done. ||| A smog outbreak in Southeast Asia last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths, according to a new study released Monday that triggered calls for action to tackle the ?killer haze?. Researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities in the US estimated there were more than 90,000 early deaths in Indonesia in areas closest to haze-belching fires, and several thousand more in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. I feel so sad at the thought of this haze killing thousands of people. ||| Air pollution is bad, so bad that it kills thousands of people each year. In India alone according to a Washington Post article published last month, about half a million people die every year due to outdoor air pollution. With that introductory paragraph, here?s a finding of a new study that may not surprise a lot of you readers: people with lung cancer may have shorter survival times when exposed to smog and other air pollutants. With the above information it is vital to pay attention to people with lung cancer. ||| The Burmese president has ordered an investigation into the case of two girls who say they were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop. The teenagers were freed last week after a journalist helped them, but their families say that the police had on numerous occasions refused their pleas to get involved. This really made me sad what the two girls went through. ||| It's a day like any other day in a provincial city in central Russia. A 12-year-old girl is getting ready to go to school. Suddenly her phone rings. The next minute she is out of the door, saying she's meeting a friend and they will go to school together. Later the same day, when her mother turns up at the school, there is no sign of her daughter. No-one has seen her. This is really sad and terrifying. ||| I am writing as regards my thoughts on Christians from Mosul, brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed, in some cases, by neighbors, and nothing ? not the priest?s pleas, not his invocation of Cain and Abel ? seemed likely to heal those scars. Khalid Ramzi, a congregant, seemed to choke on the sermon. I was so sad by this event and i hope something urgent is being done as soon as possible so that this will not happen anymore. ||| I want to address this topic and show my exact thoughts as regards the newly elected president who has insulted decorated war veterans and suggested that post-traumatic stress disorder is a sign of weakness. I do not angry with this statement as it is so disrespectful to me and such veterans should not be disrespected as such. And all the citizens should  make sure this mistake is being corrected. ||| I am writing as regards my thoughts on Polar bears, the poster-child for climate change, are among the animals most affected by the seasonal and year-to-year changes in Arctic sea ice, because they rely on this surface for essential activities such as hunting, traveling and breeding. It is really sad that as a result of climate change the polar bear are now suffering. ||| I will be stating my thought over a father and son have died after falling off a cliff during a hike. The two plunged to their death while on a trail next to Shaver Lake in Fresno, California. Which was caused by a helicopter power failure during a refueling and they made an emergency landing, meaning they couldn't get to the pair. I was really sad by this event. ||| I am expressing my concern over the fact that Nigeria has launched an investigation into reports alleging that government officials raped and sexually abused women and girls who survived Boko Haram violence. The move comes after Human Rights Watch published a report detailing accounts by dozens of women and girls who said they were sexually abused or coerced into sex. The move was a welcome development and everything should be done to make sure things like this does not happen. ||| With Much Sadness We Report Baby Isibindi Has Passed: Rhino Update From Thula Thula Rhino Orphanage: It is with many tears, a heavy heart and very mixed emotions that I write that little Isibindi passed away shortly before midnight after a very, very rough 56 hours. She went through such deep sadness in her short life. I was so hoping and fighting to give her a second chance at life. A part of me feels a deep relief ? the last two days were very difficult and she had so much to cope with. This is really sad.","It is really sad ||| I was gutted for those that were killed, and nothing was done as well ||| Thinking about this, I can only think what can really be done to curb this act ||| you are absolutely right ||| I think the Islamic leaders should speak out more against this act ||| I wonder as too as well ||| I think we should even put religion aside, it is never right to kill another person ||| oh yes you are right. I just wish Christians and Muslims can coexist peacefully ||| I think both religion should do all they can to promote peace ||| We can only continue to hope things get better while moving forward ||| me too, i will continue to do all i can as well to support peace ||| you are right mate ||| our new generation must be proud of the choice we made today as regards religion ||| And so sad considering that some people has been brainwashed and not so much we can do to change that ||| I think so too, it was a great discussion. bye ||| I think a lot of people are experiencing PTSD from combat. ||| I don't know much about the VA and the support it provides or doesn't. ||| Yeah, I can see that happening.  I wonder why this is so prevalent now when it doesn't seem to have been as much of an issue in earlier wars, like WW2 ||| Could be.  But I think it might be more than that.  We seem less capable of handling stress and anxiety.  I agree that part of it is just more talk about it and being more open, and diagnosing stuff more.  But I think we're less resilient as people for some reason too. ||| Yes, a high hope, but there at least seems to be a move towards smaller conflicts. ||| I think the relative strength and destructiveness of major powers does inhibit large-scale conflict.  Too much destruction to risk going to war, so we fought proxy battles and use diplomacy and sanctions and things like that more than hot wars.  But of course one leader could change that. ||| And if hostile aliens show up then all bets are off. ||| It would probably bring the planet together, but could also spell our doom, or enslavement, or something.  I only bring it up jokingly because of that UFO story recently. ||| Yeah, it's a big universe.  We probably don't know as much about it as we'd like to think. ||| Yeah, stay cool.  bye ||| How you feel about the article? ||| I feel same way ||| There should be more awareness in this regards ||| I'm really sad for the polar bears ||| I do not think it is too late ||| I think we should create more awareness, so it will help the generations coming more ||| If we start now there is a lot we can still achieve ||| I will suggest renewable energy ||| Yes there should strict laws that will enforce this acts ||| it is quite sad, but this is a global problem ||| So true, this honestly requires collective effort ||| we should start from our homes i guess and our immediate enviroment ||| That is so true, in my home i make use of energy saving bulbs. this will help conserve more energy ||| That sounds interesting as well ||| That is a great idea, like i said earlier we need to create a great environment for the generations to come ||| We will continue to hope things get better on the long run, it has been great chatting with you. goodbye ||| you need to type bye or goodbye ||| lower case ||| let us do it again ||| bye ||| I feel terrible about it, and you? ||| I am so sad that the polar bears are really suffering because of this ||| This is a lot to swallow. We need to find a way of solving this ||| I really hope, hopefully more awareness? ||| This too, but that should not stop more awareness as this is a global issue ||| Agreed, so tell me what your suggestions are? ||| And this change should begin with us, from our homes ||| I think making use of energy saving bulbs, not throwing dirt anywhere just do something to help conserve the energy more and help the climate ||| oh wow. I just really feel sad for the bears really ||| We need to do something the generation coming will be proud of as regards climate change ||| bye ||| Tell me how you feel about this event? ||| I feel so terrified ||| I feel so sad for the family ||| It was really too much ||| I think some investigations should be done ||| This should be prevented from happening again ||| Yes i will agree with that ||| I think that will not be a bad idea ||| it was really a malfunction. it would be hard to proffer a solution now unless we know exactly the cause of the malfunction. ||| I think a good proper check will definitely help ||| goodbye ||| Tell me what you feel about the incident? ||| I feel really sad about it ||| Yes, especially when you still have young ones at home ||| Yes, it is really as if the first years of their lives they are always looking for ways to kill themselves ||| I can only imagine that really ||| Yes, I think parents need to be more active and keep an eye on these young ones ||| Yes. what else do you think can be done to prevent this? ||| And even if they are not they should always keep an eye on their kids ||| I really feel so sad for the parents ||| sure that will be a good thing to do ||| I also think this safety measures should be advocated ||| i wonder as well ||| I am always curious whenever they are silent ||| Yes a larger part of it i must say ||| I think the media should do more to create more awareness ||| oh yeah... I think we have had a great conversation....goodbye ||| That was really a sad event ||| I think it was because of the helicopter power failure ||| No, Not sure ||| Details or No details. That's sad thing to happen to anyone ||| Sadly, that is true ||| You are on point. Details matters as well ||| That is true, But we should not deviate from the fact that, that was a tragic incident. ||| What do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence? ||| I will agree with that ||| bye ||| It was really sad ||| It is really sad that this is happening in the society ||| I agree with you ||| I think Governments are doing all they can and the military. But i doubt if there will ever be permanent solution ||| True, i think adequate punishment should be given ||| This is really sad to hear ||| What do you think can be done to prevent this from reoccurring? ||| I totally agree with you ||| I really hope it will not have really long term bad effect on the victim ||| My pleasure....bye ||| What do you think about this problem animals are facing? ||| How do you feel about the situation? ||| I feel the same, it is really sad ||| I think more money should be allocated for zoos ||| Yes, that will go a long way too ||| I also think animals should be allow to thrive at there natural habitats ||| That will really help a lot ||| I do not see that happening anyways ||| HAHA............I just we give the animals more respect ||| I hope reasonable solution will be proffered soon............It has been great chatting with you...goodbye ||| I was close to tears reading the article ||| Their were lots of young ones involved which makes it more terrifying ||| Me too, really sad situation ||| I thought things like life jacket should be used and prevents deaths ||| We can only imagine...sigh ||| I would support that as well. That would be negligent on the part of the ship owner ||| what do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence? ||| Or also providing a sure escape measures in cases of shipwrecks. ||| Not sure as well ||| Yes, so as to get over the trauma ||| Not sure they will be able to get off their minds ||| bye ||| What do you feel about the incident? ||| I feel so sad about it ||| This troubles me a lot ||| I think we need to understand the reason why that happened first? ||| I think they should always be sure of the target they are hitting? ||| I think there should be a way around that ||| The expert should be able to give reasonable answer ||| All the brains behind the air drops ||| Oh yes ||| Definitely, I hope they get deserved comfort ||| Yes as compensation probably ||| goodbye ||| what are you feelings about the incident? ||| I was so pissed reading that ||| Yes, in difficult time as that. I think what we should be thinking is a way to help the victims and not steal from them ||| It's really sickening ||| That would really make the victims sad the more ||| what do you think can be done to curb this shameless act? ||| Sure, but still there should be a balance ||| I think there should be awareness or something? ||| I totally agree with you.....It is really just sad ||| it's as if we are losing our humanity ||| sure, you are right.....goodbye ||| Tell me how you feel about the situation? ||| You nailed it honestly ||| I think that would go a long way as well ||| I think there should be more awareness to teach people how to show genuine empathy ||| Yes, also need to do this now so the generations to come do not face this sad situation. ||| It is just really terrible? ||| What do you think is best corrective measure to stop this? ||| I agree with that, do you think that is enough? ||| I also think there should be adequate punishment for whoever violates the rule ||| Well, at the end i really hope we all do the right thing.....goodbye ||| Tell what you feel about the situation? ||| It is so terryfying ||| Accident is really a terrible thing ||| Oh yes, I lost my dad through car crash so i know how it feels ||| It was honestly ||| I hope they will be able to deal with the trauma ||| What do you think can be done to prevent such occurrence? ||| I do not think that is good idea ||| I'm black ||| What do you mean by that? ||| goodbye ||| What do you think about the situation? ||| I was shocked about it though ||| You really think so? ||| HAHA.... That explains your chat then ||| I do not see that happening honestly ||| I'm trying not to believe that is true ||| I really hope that is not true because i kind of respect him ||| Do you genuinely think they can be back together? ||| Well, I hope they really. I like them together ||| haha, it was nice chatting with you. goodbye ||| How do you feel about the article? ||| Me too ||| only if they both willing to make it work ||| And that is really sad ||| Not sure i ever want that. And you? ||| Good to know we on same page as that ||| I support that ||| Not up to 10 turns mate ||| what do you think can be done to prevent such things reoccurring in the society? ||| And before getting into any marriage be sure you really want to spend the rest of your life with that person ||| Good chatting with you....goodbye ||| how do you feel about the sad situation? ||| I feel so sad reading that ||| That was really sick ||| I would do the same if i was in that country ||| That act was inhumane ||| Only if they can be helped ||| I feel so sad for them ||| I'm really happy about that at least ||| That was really positive ||| I hope they are really defeated completely soon..... goodbye ||| Tell me how you feel about the article? ||| i feel the same ||| what do you think went wrong? ||| I do not have idea too ||| Not sure and you? ||| But it's really so sad how haze can kill thousands of people ||| I never thought so too ||| I really feel so sad for their families ||| I hope so too, something just to help ||| it has been good chatting with you, goodbye ||| Tell me how you feel about the article? ||| And why did you say that? ||| oh, do you have any idea about the topic before? ||| I feel sad for people living with lung cancer in general ||| it is never a good thing to deal with ||| Not really, but i read articles about people living with it ||| Not really, Just feel pity for them. ||| I would change my ways toward the person ||| By not feeling sad for them again ||| No, it is not. ||| By conducting more research? ||| I think getting data from all hospitals, or having a data base for that will help ||| Not for now, maybe in the near future. ||| Not ready for the commitment i have to put into the research project ||| sad and hope there is anything that can be the done ||| well then fine, i think we have a good conversation. goodbye ||| What do you think about the article? ||| I feel so sad about it ||| It was so terrible and to think the police was not helping ||| I think appropriate punishment should be given ||| What do you think as well? ||| i support that too ||| That is right, what do you think about Swen Win? ||| Yes she was the hero of the story ||| I really applauded her ||| I really do not want to think about that ||| I need to tell you first.... goodbye ||| yes i feel so sad about it ||| why do you think that happened? ||| I'm guessing so too ||| i guess so too, that is sad ||| what do you think can be done to prevent this ||| wow, i really can not think of any solution now ||| wow, really ||| how do you these animals can be helped at least? ||| I totally agree with you ||| it saddens me honestly ||| bye ||| Tell me what you think about the article? ||| I feel so sad about it ||| Yes i was surprised when i found out ||| I will agree with that ||| Maybe it is more about mental health? ||| Yes, i think so too ||| I'm actually more concerned about the mental health status. I think it is the major factor ||| wow, those are large numbers ||| what do you think can be done to prevent this? ||| I totally agree with that. goodbye ||| Well, i think more awareness should be done so people with mental health can get help ||| More awareness means urging people with it to get help which i believe some will willing want to get help as well. ||| That is absolutely correct ||| I think it is about priorities. ||| Maybe there are more important this people focused on ||| Yes i do, but sadly so many people do not. ||| Thank you, bye"
p006,I read about a young teenage girl who committed suicide. She was Parisian and i think 14 years old. She was having trouble in school and i think was being bullied. It saddens me her response to the stresses she was experiencing led to suicide. I can't imagine the sadness she felt and how she maybe felt alone in her situation. I hope her family finds some solace.  ||| What a tragic story. I cannot imagine the sorrow the people affected have gone through. I hope society can come up with a solution for terrorism and that it can help in the future. It is sad that many people around the world have had to go through this event or something similar to it. There are too many stories around the world that are similar. ,"I have in the past. Have you? ||| I can relate to that. I was not severely bullied. It was off and on through elementary and some of middle school. In those moments of being bullied, i would usually ignore it. I was a resilient kid. Are you still friends with that person? ||| I think it depends. I think the bully that happens today is a bit different from the kind many experienced back then. Also, kids that get bullied today, their response to bullying varies. ||| Yes, that's what i meant. Bullying does not end even when you're home. What do you think would be an appropriate response to bullying? ||| That is true. Social media has made a great impact on younger generations. I cannot imagine the impact it would have had on me as a kid. I do agree that inclusion is important and vital. I have never thought of the idea of assigning emotional support classmates. That is an absolutely great idea. Have you seen this used in the real world? ||| How do you mean? ||| I see. That is a something completely possible. I can see adults playing a better role for emotional support within the classroom. Perhaps having an assigned adult per classroom or something of that sort. ||| We had something similar in elementary as well. Except, from what i remember, they were teachers assistants. They did the typical TA duties but were there as well to provide emotional support. I am curious too how a normal day is at a public school. ||| I was homeschooled for high school. As a teen i absolutely hated it at first but now that i am older i have come to appreciate it. Public education is definitely not where is should be. I wish the government would make education a focus. It's been busy on other things of course. ||| Bye. Thanks! ||| bye ||| I have memory of it. ||| Yes, very shocking. ||| Absolutely crazy how many people died due the coordinated events. I remember i was at the library at the time and reading upon the events. I cannot imagine the pain the families were and are in then and now. ||| Terrifying. I wonder what has been done since then to protect the public from such attacks. ||| Yes, i remember that as well. Were those events related? ||| I see. ||| It's interesting to see the different types of terror attacks the occur between both the US and Europe. The US having the one man terror attacks and abroad having a more group coordinated type.  Horrible overall. ||| That starts in legislation and regulation. ||| yes ||| bye"
p007,"Guys, reading this article really hits home for me. If you  or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please get help from the available sources. Suicide is no joke and it is a shame when someone does not get the help they need. I've struggled with this for a few years now but I got the help I needed. This woman was not as fortuante. ||| Hey guys. So I just read this article about Iraqi Christians being persecuted by Muslims in Iraq. I don't understand why people of different religious backgrounds can't get along there. I'm sure it is a cultural thing but it is such unneccesary violence and conflict. It hurts both sides and I wish there was a way we could get them to set aside their differences. But not military action. We don't need another war. ||| I just read an article about cancer and how it effects a person. I know how cancer feels; I've dealt with family members getting cancer in my childhood. It was rough. But it takes a lot fo strength to get through the treatments. And I just want to say that if you have cancer, you can do it. you can beat it and get through it. No matter how gloomy the day may be look forward to a brighter tomorrow. ||| So I just read an article about how a father and his son died from a fall while hiking because there was a problem with the rescue chopper and they couldn't get to them in time. I think that is completely unacceptable. Why wasn't there a second rescue chopper? Is there no such thing as a back up? The loss of life could have been prevented. ||| I think it is absolutely saddening that these animals  were neglected in such a bad area of the world. Not only were a lot killed/starved but they were in a warzone! Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo right in one of the most fought over areas in the middle east? Those poor animals had to suffer for people's enjoyment in a horrible place. ||| The state in the middle east is a mess. I wish we are not involved as it is not our business, but fo course we must be the world police. I do not think we should be picking sides in pollitical struggles that do not pertain to us. By doing so we just create more needless death. Let them settle their own problems. ||| I tihnk it is so sad that that man lost his wife and kid in a car wreck. If the person who hit them was indeed street racing; he caused a family unknowable greif. No one deserves to die liek that; on fir ein a car. And no one deserves to go through that kind of grief. I hope that man gets the support he needs, and I hope his family did not have to suffer before they passed. ||| I think it is kinda messed up the way Jolie acts in her relationships. Wearing a vial of eachother's blood? That is weird. I wonder if she was overly controlling as well. I dated someone who was extremely controlling and manipulative and it was one fo the worst periods of my life. I feel for all the guys she's been with. ||| House fires are nojoke. And theyc an happen to anyone at any time. I feel so bad that that poor family are now without a home and there beloved pets. I hope their animals didn't have to suffer before they passed and I hope that the family is able to move on from this tragedy and will be able to continue their lives from this point on. ||| I think it is so sad for that baby rhino to die so young.. Any creature deserves a chance at life, and for this baby's to be taken away so soon is just heartbreaking. Also the fact that it was an orphan makes it even sadder. I used to work at an animal rescue place and sometimes we would ahve animals that wouldn't make it.. it is really hard to see an animal pass. ||| I know there are a lot of specific circumstances and things pertaining to police shootings of African Americans, but hoenstly a lot of these cases seem like the cop is just really trigger happy. And honestly that is unacceptable. African Americans are racially profiled and that is wrong. I think there has to be something done with our law enforcement to make these shootings less likely to occur. ||| So suicide rates are climbing in our youth today. I know this topic very personally. I suffer from chronic depression and when I was 19 tried to take my own life. What the article says is true. Parents, talk to your kids, be there for them. Listen when they need you to. I had problems with that; and combined with a lot of other trauma, I reached a breaking point. Don't let your kids reach that point. ||| I think it is abysmal that womena re getting raped in that part of the world. Sexual abuse is no laughing matter and the people who commit these atrocities need to pay for their actions. Taking advantage of someone; no matter their gender, background, or religious preference, is unacceptable. And the fact that not much is being done about it makes it even more disgusting. ||| I think something has to be done about the migrant situation in the mediterranean. The migrants take very rough routes and in really ill prepared boats. Many die because there are not official migration routes for refugees. It is a shame that these people ahve to risk their lives just to get into a better country. ||| Companies need to be held accountable for what happens with their factory waste. The fact that this company is not properly cleaning up after the big mining disaster in Brazil is unacceptable. It saddens me that the people who lived off the river cannot properly continue their way of life due to the environmental impact of that company. ||| I thin it is really sad that migrants have to go through the hardships that they do. It is unimaginable for me to have to leave my home, my things, my life, at the drop of a hat. These people leave behind mostly everything to get to a better place, and a lot die before they can get there. It is a shame that people have to do things like this in this day and age. ||| I don't understand all the conflict in the middle east. So many innocent people are constantly dying for literally no reason. The death and suffering is needless. I hate that we are the world police though. It isn't our problem to fix; and these countries do not seem to want to change. The entire area has been in war and conflict for hundreds of years. It is just a shame. ||| Man the fact that so many people have died or been sickened by this toxic smoke is upsetting. I hope the efforts to stop this problem bear fruit because dying from some pollution that shouldn't really be there is kinda crappy. Plus fires are no joke as well. Just look at California. They get bad ones every year. ||| I think it is messed up that Saudi women have to have the permission of a man to travel, work, study, etc. Like they are their own person. Why do they need someone elses permission to do soemthing they want. They aren't property. Well I guess in that culture they kinda are... but that is really messed up. I just think it is wrong.","Hey there, this article is pretty morbid. It really hits home for me though since I've dealt with this subject before. ||| Yea suicide is no joke. It took me a couple of years before I received the help I needed and still it was a struggle. I feel so bad that this poor woman didn't get help. It's really messed up. ||| Exactly. Plus it really really hurts when people like, look at you as less of a person for having these issues. ||| I always hated it when people told me that. Especially family members. Never had a doctor say that though. Must've been so so rough for this woman. ||| It's a shame and just messed up. I can't imagine the extent of the dread she felt. Like I've been there, but for so many repeated attempts to get help, just to be turned away.. that'll mess you up so much more. ||| Honestly, the first step is that people just need to take these things seriously. And insurance companies need to start covering treatments. It took me forever to find a decent psych. And of course insurance doesn't cover it. It's messed up. It all comes down to money these days I think. ||| For sure. Through my experience I find that it is older people that are the most..uh.. skeptical when it comes to topics/illnesses like these. ||| Oh man the amount of times I heard \suck it up\"" or \"" you have no reason to be depressed.\"" That messed me up bad."" ||| For sure. It's kinda messed up when your own family is ignorant to your blatantly obvious issues. Which ties back into that article. I can't even inagine what it feels like for a doctor to just tell you to get over it. That's like going to the police to report a major crime and they just say \deal with it yourself.\"""" ||| Yea and you'd think that they would be. But of course healthcare takes a backseat to like idk.. butter knife licenses or something pointless. On a side note though.. drowning in the ocean must be one of the worst ways to go. Like thats prolonged panic and suffering before lights out. Legit sounds absolutely horrible. ||| For sure. You have to be really desperate to put yourself through that. I'm glad I never hit that point; I'd rather it be quick if it was gonna happen. But lord, that woman's death was so needless. It did not need to happen and the fact that help was refused is so disgusting. I wonder if those doctors even felt remorse about it. ||| Ah yea they probably deal with death all the time. Didn't think about that. ||| For real. But will they actually do anything is the real question. I'm not sure if half of them take mental issues seriously either. ||| That is a good point. Sometimes it does take a tragedy from someone famous to get the ball rolling. Kinda sad that it does take that though to be honest. ||| As with most things in our lives I suppose. ||| And honestly that is what we need. Just some good education to get people to realize that this stuff is serious. Well anyway, it's been a lovely chat with you Random Turker. Here's hoping the rest of the work day goes smoothly :) ||| bye ||| Hey there! So this article is something. I can't help but wonder why people of different religious backgrounds can't seem to get along in that part of the world. We seem to do ok over here in the West. ||| Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening. ||| Yea. I don't understand it personally. I guess their religion demands them to kill? Or maybe people in power have just twisted it into that meaning. It's just a shame though that people are being persecuted for their beliefs. What does it matter if someone else worships a different being than you? How does that effect you? ||| Of course it comes down to control. I hate that people ar elike that to eachother tho. But of course I suppose it is in our nature to try to be dominant over eachother. Also as for Westboro, those people disgust me. Absolute degenerates full of hatred. ||| I just hate that so many people need to suffer. It isn't right, no matter the reason, to persecute and murder people. And using religious views as a cover isn't an excuse. It also doesn't help that entire part of the world is so volitile in general. Hasn't there been conflict there for literal centuries? ||| Don't forget the oil as well. We gotta chug that sweet sweet crude at the expense of our own soldiers lives, and the natives lives. It's a vicious cycle of greed, and power ||| And the trauma of war in general as well. Always living in fear of weather or not you are going to get bombed, shot, raped, etc. I'm sure that there is an immense amount of suffering in that region. ||| Well the only thing we can do is use military, but that in and of itself is a bad thing because then they hate us even more. ||| Hmm. Not sure what we could do in that regard. I don't think they'll listen to the UN. Ugh it's just a complicated situation. ||| Same here. ||| Indeed I do. Right in the bible belt. ||| Yea. Thats why when you mentioned Westboro I immediately was like. Ew. ||| Yea most of the time. People around here hate that group. They picketed at a marines funeral here once. ||| Yes I do. ||| My Uncle is in the Marines haha. Anyway, It's been a lovely conversation with you random turker. Have a great rest of the work day c: ||| bye ||| Oh man. I'm surprised this HIT brought up cancer. Thats such a huge and saddening topic. ||| It really is. I'm glad that woman in the article had sucha  positive outlook on it though. I've dealt with several family members getting cancer when I was a kid and there was a lot of suffering. ||| I lost my dad last year to a brain tumor. And my Grandmother had a rare bone marrow cancer. You'd think with all the medical technology we have now adays we could find a cure wit hlike gene therapy or something. ||| Honestly with the amount of money that is generated from cancer treatments and donations they probably are. God that would be absolutely horrible though. ||| It really is. Very sad that people value currency over their fellow man. Back toa bout the woman though, I wonder what drives her to have such a positive outlook. My father was very depressed when he got ill, which is a very normal reaction. I just wonder what enabled this woman to be so optimistic about it all. ||| That is a good point. I suppose getting told that you might be dying would make anyone think about their life and everything. ||| I guess religion also helps. If you are that kind of person of course. It's such a rough disease though. And we still use chemo. I wish we'd find some better treatments at least. When my dad went through chemo he got so much worse. Mentally and illness wise. ||| My dad wasn't very religious so I guess all he saw was the end and that was it. I can't imagine going through cancer personally. You need a lot of strength to get through the treatments and still somehow have a positive outlook. ||| We need 15 messages each. we are only halfway through. And likewise I surely hope neither of us, or anyone for that matter has to deal with it :( ||| Of my dads cancer? ||| Oh yea. Uncontrolled cell division because of a mutation in the genes that control how much a cell can divide and when that function turns off. ||| Pretty sure its a mutation in the DNA of the cell. Or is it the RNA? Been a hot minute since I learned all this stuff haha. ||| It's all good everyone has their interests c: ||| Id assume not smoking, drinking, and wearing sunscreen is the best you can do ||| Why thank you. Most of this I remember from the doctor talking to my dad. ||| Yup it's time. It was a good chat. Hope the rest of your day is productive and smooth c: ||| bye ||| Hey there, I think it's pretty messed up that those people died from a result of the chopper being borked. ||| You would think that they would have some sort of backup plan or maybe a spare chopper though. ||| I wonder if they are underequipped to handle situations. Maybe they don't get enough funding. ||| I mean if so that is pretty messed up; especially in Cali. People get hurt hiking and rock climbing all the time there so you'd think they'd beef up the rescue response. ||| If I recall the response to the recent wildfire was kinda eh as well. Search and Rescue wise I mean. The firefighters worked their butts off. ||| Real talk. Those people go at their job hardcore. Although seeing as Cali has wildfires literally every year they are probably better funded as well. ||| True. Their role is equally as important though. Too many ill prepared people do risky things and end up in trouble. ||| Wait really? What the hell? That's kinda messed up. Even if they oppose him pollitically like, their people too dude. ||| Yea for sure.. I guess he's gotta funnel all that money into the wall though right? ||| It's gotta be 10 each. ||| Yea for sure. Any service does when people's lives are on the line. ||| Man cops get too much flak. Yes some of them are corrupt and some are trigger happy, but the majority are legit there to do their job. ||| Yea. Around my area they are really good. I think only one in the past 6ish years has been thrown off the force for doing something dumb. ||| They do that here too around christmas. Although I have a feeling they are underfunded as well. They still drive beat up partol cars from the 90's ||| Amen to that. But of course we gotta be the world police right? Ugh. ||| Yea it's all just a waste of lives, money, resources, etc. ||| We are in Afganistan, Iraq, Iran (unofficially, but I know people based there,) basically like every country in the middle east at this point. ||| Oh man yea truth for sure. I bet that new space force is gonna get proper funding though amirite? Man we are in such a pit as a country right now. ||| Yea I know how that feels personally. It's bull. Our monetary allocation is all over the place. ||| Yea totally. Hell my mom can't even afford her medication to function every day. It is ridiculous. ||| Maybe one day things will get better. One can hope. ||| Anyway rantom Turker it's been a great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday! :) goodbye ||| Yea that is really really messed up. The people committing these crimes should pay for them. Sexual abuse is no joke at all and I hate that those women have to go through it with no hope.. ||| It really does. Rape in general is just one of those unforgivable things and it sickens me that people are barbaric enough to commit it. ||| Likewise, and I've been sexually abused before so I somewhat know what they are going through; not the hopelessness but the pain.. ||| Yea people are really messed up. Luckily i got the help I needed but those poor women have to endure it.. I don't like that our country is the \wold police\"" but those rapists deserve a bullet real talk."" ||| I mean I'm all for helping countries get more developed but some of them just don't want too. And honest people ahve to suffer because of it. ||| I just hate that people have to deal with that stuff in general. Like I wish we as a species could get past the whole oversexualization thing. Like I get it's biological but damn no means no. Keep it in your pants ya dig? ||| Yea we had a big case here a couple of years ago where a cop was going around raping women. It was really messed up but he got thrown in jail for it. ||| Yea it really does. You would think they would try to improve but I guess the people in power enjoy what they got going on. ||| Yea it is pretty rough; it's evenw orse as a man because a lot of people think that because you are a man you can't be raped. Especially if you are sexually abused by a woman. ||| Which it for sure isnt. Like if I don't want it it is the same as if ai woman doesn't want it. Doesn't help that it was in high school either at a time in my life where I was heavily depressed. Of course no one wants to lsisten to a high school kid about that though; especially in the bible belt. ||| How Ironic my family is catholic too! ||| Yea they were really hush hush about my issues. Kinda sucked; kinda forced religion on me but it is what it is. ||| Well now that I'm an adult i got the help I needed so it worked out in the end. It was just rough for a while. ||| Yea I'm glad to be a functioning member of society now haha. I just wish those poor women in nigera could get the same amount of help I did. It isn't fair. ||| True that. ||| bye ||| I think it is really sad that those animals had to suffer. Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo in one of the most war torn areas in the middle east? ||| That is for sure true; I just think the location for sure doesn't help. Either way though animals shouldn't have to suffer like that. ||| This reminds me of another article I read for one of these HITs maybe 3 days ago; but there was another zoo where people were feeding the tigers mango because they couldn't afford to feed them meat. It was in Venezuela :( ||| Yea. Maybe it was greed at the pollitical level, but for sure not the zoo. I don't understand though why people feel the need to get exotic animals even though they cant properly take care of them; especially a zoo. People are really messed up when it comes to flipping a profit. Even the japanese are exploiting animals again for cash; they started whaling again. Well technically they never stopped but now it is official on paper again. ||| Holy crap they are worth that much? Man that is so wrong. No wonder the problem is so persistant if the market is that good. Such a shame though. And yea I don't understand how some rhino horn can treat the common cold. That's just needless slaughter. Oh don't get me started on shark-fin soup either... ||| It always brings a smile to my face when people go out of their way to help animals in need. I used to volunteer at a shelter her ein my city. I love helping out rescued animals. ||| Yea that guys is legit going the distance. Truely a champion. It takes a lit of courage and resolve to go through all of that. I have never personally gone out and rescuded the animals, but I always groomed them, fed them, and made sure they could find a great home. I don't think I could pull a rescue operation in a warzone. I'd for sure crumble under the stress. ||| I did adopt one actually haha! Best dog I've ever had. His owner had left him abandoned in a shed with no food for 3 weeks. Apparently used to beat him because he gets scared if you raise your hands. was really a mess when he came in but now hes the happiest boy you've ever seen. ||| Oh yea a little bit of tlc goes a long way. Animals just wanna live and be loved. ||| Yea it is really sad. A dog will always be loyal. A blessing but also a curse. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt this dog; he is so sweet. But then again I can't see why anyone would abuse an animal. It's just wrong on so many levels. ||| Yea I hope that tiger can live out the rest of it's days peacefully. And likewise! ||| bye ||| Hello there. That article is kinda messed up huh. I think it is a shame that a lot of these people end up dying trying to get to a better place. ||| You'd think they'd try to set some official migration routes or something. It is saddening that women and children have to risk their lives crossing the sea. ||| Exactly. A lot of needless death and risk. I can't imagine being stuck in a rickety overcrowded boat in the middle of the ocean. ||| Yea. I wonder why they haven't tried doing anything about it yet honestly. It is clearly a problem. ||| Yea that makes sense. We are currently going through that immigration struggle as well. It's just a messed up situation in both places. ||| Indeed. Both sides are usually on the extremes and no one wants to meet in the middle. Meanwhile people end up suffering. ||| Likewise, I feel like we need reform, but people trying to get in and getting hurt sucks. Like if the system wasn't so bad I feel like people would just try to get in officially instead of sneaking in. But you never know. There isn't an esy solution. ||| Yea the process is hard, and long. I guess that is why people just try to sneak in. Sometime sthey can't afford to wait for all the red tape. ||| Yea true that. It is pretty sad to beging with that people have to leave their homes because of the pollitical/economic climate their home country has. ||| Yea the whole world police schtick hasn't been working out very well for us. ||| Yea we are at 10. ||| bye! ||| Honestly I think it is pretty messed up that the company in charge of the mining accident aren't cleaning up the polution effectively. ||| Well at the very least I think they should make more of an effort to help better the situation. After all it is their mess that is impacting the lives of a lot of people that live off the river. Well lived. They can't really live off of it that well now anyways. ||| I don't recall if there were any human casualties, but tons of wildlife for sure. The local environment there must be incredibly messed up from all that polluted water. ||| Isn't Flint still messed up? Or did they ever resolve that situation ||| Man thats sad. The water supply getting borked messes up so much stuff. I wonder what kind of pollutants were in that mining waste. I know gold miners us emercury to form an amalgam with the gold to catch it from the panning machines. I hope it isnt a ton of heavy metals/mercury in that river. ||| Same. Although theya re smart to not drink that water. That can cause a lot of problems down the line. ||| Of course. As long as the money is actually going to help. ||| Yea, makes you wonder where all that money is going. ||| We aren't done yet; it is 10 messages each. This message is the 9th :) But yea either way companies should totally be held accountable for their pollution. ||| You know it is possible but it could also be a man made disaster. Either way im surprised there were no precautions in place to keep the waste from getting in the river in general. ||| Yea I just hope things improve for those people, and the wildlife. ||| Well we are at 10 now if you wanna stop ||| No no it's all good haha. ||| bye ||| Man the situation in the middle east is a mess. Not sure why we always have to pick a side but lots of needless death for sure. ||| That and why do we ahve to act like the world police? Not everything is our problem. ||| I just think it is all a waste. We throw soldiers at wars we shouldn't even be involved in just to flex. It's pretty dumb. ||| Yep. And we end up dealing with everyone elses problems ||| Honestly probably not. I wish we would but it's doubtful we ever will. ||| Yea, My cousin was in desert storm and lost a leg and all of his friends/squad in an ied explosion. ||| Yea he also got cancer from all the chemicals they used :( ||| Yea true that. They do their job for all of us, even if it isn't for the best reason ||| Apologies for the slow response My dog had an accident I had to clean. Anyway, the whole middle east is messed up. Why do they keep fighting eachother anyway? ||| Me too. We just need to stay out of the worlds business and focus on improving our own country. ||| For sure. Can we start with Healthcare please? That need a big clean up. ||| For sure! anyway, it's been a good convo fellow turker! goodbye! ||| I think it is a greatidea to host an exhibit to try and educate people on what these migrants have to go through. It saddens me though that people have to go through struggles like this and drop everything though just to escape with their lives to a better place. ||| Hmm I'm not sure. You can teach/mimic the feelings that these people got hrough; but that doesn't mean for certain that someone will still feel empathy towards them. ||| Yea some people just do not care about their fellow man no matter what. It is still good though to expose the general populous to the lives of these people though; Some education never hurts. ||| Well first of all I think we need to reform the official immigration process. It is a lot of red tape and waiting etc. That's why people just try to sneak in all the time. But as long as they are productive members of society I see no problem with immigration. ||| Yea it really is. Totally messed up. I can't imagine how traumatic that is for a child, let alone their parents. ||| It's just really messed up when you start treating actual people like less than human. ||| Exactly. These are real people, just like us. But of course our president doesn't see that all he sees are colours in his crayon box that he doesn't like. ||| Well again I don't think you can teach empathy; but just educate people on the experiences and feelings of others. ||| Yea like I said earlier, a little education never hurts. Not everyone will give a damn but the decent people will. ||| Well a better immigration policy would probably help. If they could go through the official process easier they wouldn't have to sneak in and risk their lives. ||| Yes lets hope. And likewise! Have a great rest of the workday fellow turker :) ||| goodbye! ||| I think it is so sad that that man lost his wife and child due to a freak car wreck.. I really hope the guy wasn't street racing because that is just senseless. ||| I really hope that the father gets the support he needs. It is unimaginable the amount of grief he must be going through. ||| True, but to lose your wife and another kid in the same day still has to be rough. I hope they didn't suffer before the end but with the car on fire that might not exactly be the case.. ||| Yea legit I don't think I would be a functioning person after that. ||| Yea he needs to surround himself with those he has left. ||| That could be a factor in stopping accidents like this; but also I think drivers need to be 200x more responsible. ||| I mean after all when you drive you are responsible not only for yourself but everyone else on the road. ||| Hmm.. Not sure. Like I know plenty of responsible younger people who drive safe; and Plenty of older people who drive safe. Maybe there needs to be more education on just how much your driving impacts others? Although some poeple just don't care at the end of the day which is kinda messed up. ||| My dad used to do that with me in the car. Was scary as a kid. ||| Yea he was kinda messed up; and thanks. But I agree people who drive like maniacs or abuse drugs while behind the wheel are really inconsiderate and not at all responsible. ||| Oh wow thats crazy. I'm sorry for your loss :( ||| I bet.. I've never had to deal with losing anyone from a car wreck. which is surprising seeing as half my family drive like maniacs. ||| Hell I don't even drive: I walk everywhere. Too anxious to get behind the wheel. ||| I mean I would drive but the thought of hurting someone else or doing something stupid etc just gets to me super bad. ||| Thanks, well it has been a great conversation random turker. I hope you have a great rest of the workday :) ||| goodbye ||| Man that whole Vial of Blood thing is kinda messed up. ||| That Jolie wore when they were with billy bob. Thats kinda creepy, wearing eachother's blood in a necklace. ||| I wonder if she was really controlling and manipulative too in her relationships. ||| I was with someone who was kinda like that before; really emotionally abusive. They did weird things too like keeping my hair etc. ||| Yea it wasn't a great time :( I feel for all the guys jolie has dated because if shes anothing like my ex those guys deserve some space. ||| Yea same. People are crazy though. Like if I see any of those red flags again you can bet im long gone. ||| Yea that is what I do now. Made that mistake once never going to happen again haha. ||| Thanks, I hope you never have to go through a crazy relationship. Stuff messes you up ||| it isn't time to leave yet. we still have to do 2 more messages each ||| Yea that is a good practice. I wish I was that sensible before I had a bad time haha. ||| True that, wouldn't be a better me if I didn't go through some bad times first. anyway it's beena  nice convo random turker :) have a great rest of the work day ||| bye! ||| I feel really bad for the innocent people stuck in the middle of that warzone. I don't understand why the middle east is such a hub for conflict. It is really needless. ||| Well I don't think you could really ever get rid of any militant group. There are always martyrs and inspire youth to take up their cause. ||| Yea kids get it the worst, they are either indoctrinated into the groups, orphaned by war, or killed/tortured by the bad guys. And if they live theya re traumatized for the rest of their lives. ||| They do all sorts of messed up things over there. My friend served a combat duty and told me he saw peoples heads on pikes and just bodies in the streets. ||| For sure, my friend didnt speak for a week when he killed for the first time. He was in the bomb unit as well so you can imagine how stressful it is getting shot at let alone defusing IEDs ||| that palce is like..steeped in death. I think theyve been in conflict for a few hundred years at least. In general i mean; of course militant groups are different now. ||| Agreed. Conflict like that here would be crazy. Especially because everyone and their mother owns a gun or two. ||| In the middle east? I don't think so. Theya re pretty set in their ways over there; I don't even think the war effort by us is even really making a difference. ||| I..I don't know. I didn't even think of that. Man that could be really horrifying... ||| Likewise, great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday random turker. :) ||| goodbye! ||| It's crazy. I can't imagine dying because of some toxic smoke. Not only can you be killed by suffocation, but if you survive down the line you could get cancer. Totally not cool ||| Was the smoke toxic from pollution or was it because of what was burning? ||| Yea and it''s not like you can hold your breath forever. 100k though, that is so many people. Way too much death for sure. ||| That's legit a small town. Grief and suffering on an unimaginable scale. It is really sickening. I wonder if there will be better precautions in the future so this doesn't happen again. ||| I'd hope so. A repeat of this would be even more tragic. ||| Man that is messed up if so. Death is death.You would think some government agency or company would step in and try to prevent accidents like this from happening. ||| Well Cali has a ton of wildfires, but they actively fight those every year. ||| I think maybe like 300-400 last year? but no not on the scale of these chemical fires. ||| Well yea lightning can strike and start a fire, so can some stupid camper who didnt put out their campfire; or a person throwing a cigarette out the window of their car. I don't think you can prevent them 100% but maybe if people do not do silly thing you could prevent like 50% of the fires. ||| Yea very good convo. Have a great rest of the workday random turker! Goodbye! ||| Man I feel so bad for that family. House fires are so random and it sucks that they happen. It is a shame that they lost their pets too :( ||| Usually yea. Maybe the smoke got them. Really sad. I hope the family is able to find a new home and move on.. ||| It is possible. I could se it being an electrical fire. Especially in an older home. ||| I can't imagine literally losing everything in an instant. Especially my pets... I cant fathom what that family is going though. ||| Yea I'm really like sympathetic to animals. I used to work at a rescue shelter. That's wher eI got my current bundle of pent up energy haha. ||| Yea.. that isn't a great way to die.. I hope the children of that family are handling it ok ||| I mean cats are usually pretty smart when they ahve to be as well so.. Maybe they were locked in a  room? ||| For sure.. I'm glad no humans were hurt, but the animal thing really pulls my heartstrings.. ||| Yea thats usually covered in homeowners i think. Man if they didnt have insurance though...thats one bad hole to be stuck in. I really hope that they make it through this and get the support they need. ||| Oh yea.. Maybe some charitable organizations can help them out. That would be nice. ||| likewise! have a great rest of the workday :) goodbye! ||| I think it is so heartbreakin that that baby rhino died :( ||| Like I used to work in animal rescue so like, any animal suffering or dying hits me hard. ||| I'm not sure the article doesn't really say. I'd assume some complications when it was born or maybe it was sickly. ||| I wonder why it was an orphan though. Maybe it's aprents were poached for ivory? ||| I think it's kinda messed up that they believe that ivory had medicinal properties over there. They kill so many animals just for their horns and stuff there. ||| Well I know the local rangers and law enforcement at the animal reserves have beefed up their patrol efforts. I think they even patrol at night now. But other than like mroe patrols i dont think there is much they can do. Poachers build their own guns to hunt with, so it is hard to keep them unarmed. ||| Thos epoaches guns are so sketch though, I remember reading something where one was killed because the gun exploded when he went to take down an elephant. He got trampled. ||| Yea they legit make them out of low grade pipes and any scrap they can find. A lot fo them arent even capable of firing modern cartridges and are used like flintlock rifles. ||| Well, I'd say the game reserves/ orphanages need more funding. But toher than that I think they are doing all they can. I think it mostly comes down to controlling the poaching. Which is a hard task to do. ||| Yea I just hate that those animals are getting killed just for one body part. It's a waste. ||| Same. Anyway great talking to you fellow turker. Have a great rest of the workday :) bye! ||| I hope it will. I think it is really messed up how women are treated over ther ein that culture. No one should be treated as property. Plus theya re their own person; why do they need the permission of a man do so like literally anything? ||| You make a valid point that is pretty unfair of me to apply my values onto them in that way. ||| I'm not sure. Like i guess they are used to the set ways over there, or they just aren't bothered by it. I mean at the end of the day it is their choice to go along with it or oppose it, and since they are okay with it I guess it would be wrong of me to judge them for that since they are the primary party effected by the rule. ||| Yea. Like my first impression was bad for sure because I immediately looked at things from like, our culture's point of view. I didn't think about it from their perspective. Which makes me kinda look like an ***hole. I hope things work out ok though for both parties of women over there though. Pollitical reform is always a hard road to travel. I hope that some positive progress is made. ||| Personally no, all I know is that there is a lot of conflict in that area and there has been for a while. Please enlighten me if you can; I am always open to learning new things ||| Oh wow. I did not know any of that. That explains why their ways over there seem like they are set in stone; because the pretty much kinda are. ||| You know that kinda reminds me about all the church groups here that really hare lgbt and leftist pollitical ideals here in the south. So in that regard the traditionalists there and here aren't that different. ||| I don't think extremism is ever good but that's just me. I hate violence. I don't think it is right to hurt people over beliefs. I'm sure there are groups here though that also fund violence. How does the KKK get all of it's funding? Someone's gotta be donating to them right? ||| Of course. Coexistance is what we need. We don't need to try to constantly police everything over there for sure. ||| I mean anything is possible. It just might take some time. Hopefully no violence comes out of it though. ||| Yea it would be interesting to hear more from their side about it. It's always nice to gain an understanding of both sides. ||| Maybe they don't want to \rock the boat.\"" Or maybe they are just used to the system the way it is and don't mind it. I wish we could ask them."" ||| Yea it would be intersting to know now many men are willing to end the system. ||| I'm not sure. On the one half, you have the men who want to keep everything the same, and on the other there may be some who think that the women deserve a little more freedom on what they do. I'm sure there's plenty of arguing on both sides. Just like there is here about lgbt issues. ||| Hmm. Not entirely sure. Maybe they could reduce the senarios where they would need permission from a man to do things? Like working or studying. ||| Likewise! have a great rest of the workday random turker! bye! ||| I think the whole trigger happy law enforcement situation in America is kinda messed up. What do you think? ||| For real. I live in the south and minorities are profiled constantly. An officer was just removed from the force in Chattanooga because he profiled a man just sitting on his porch and ende dup shooting the poor guy and his dog. ||| Yea around here if you are white the cops don't care unless you are dealing drugs. It is pretty sad that I can wlak alone at 3am and they dont care but as soon as they see a black guy hes getting searched. ||| Around here everyone doesn't like cops. They are shady. There have meen many cases of them being removed from the force; plus cases of people impersonating them to do messed up stuff. Oh and the excessive force. ||| Yea people tend to ignore things when it isn't happening to them personally or when it is swept under the rug. I just wish we as a whole weren't so prejudice towards eachother. It's dumb we're all people who cares about what ethnicity we are. ||| Yea lately there seems to be these emerging polar opposite sides in society. And both sides take things too far. Violence isn't the answer people. Ghandi and MLK did a ton without ever raising a hand against anyone. Things now adays are getting so far out of hand with all these shootings and riots. ||| If only we could actually act like that. Here in the south it is disgusting how people act towards eachother. I hear nbombs constantly. People always judge you by how you look. Especially the older people. They can be the worst. I remember being in a grocery store once and an older man wouldn't go through the checkout line unless it was a white girl ringing him up. caused a big scene voer something so stupid. ||| I know right? God cops though of all people need to practice being non biased. They're supposed to protect people not shoot up people because of their skin color. ||| I'm not sure. It really just comes down to us human beings not being trash. Maybe some stricter laws or soemthing pertaining to when you can actually shoot someone as a cop. But yea i really don't know. ||| Yea. I don't wish death on the older people but theya re so stuck in their ways that I don't think we can make positive change until 20ish years in the future.. ||| Oh haha sorry I misunderstood. Anyway it's been a great convo random turker! Have a great rest of the day c: goodbye!"
p008,"I love elephants so much and every time I hear about them being abused this way it hurts my heart. I hate that people can be so cruel to animals in general, but to such sweet, gentle giants? It makes me so sad. And her name is Nosey. That's not even fair, someone needs to strip that awful man of that angelic creature. ||| I'd bet money on the driver of the car that hit the trailer being a drunk driver. I feel like the amount of people who drive drunk - generally, but especially on holidays - is honestly alarming. And they're always so casual about it, like it's not a big deal and they aren't taking the lives of anyone they get remotely near while behind the wheel into their hands. ||| Oh my gosh, I wonder what went wrong. Those poor people! I can't fathom what it would be like to just be going about my life when a sudden explosion turns my entire world upside down. Recovering from serious burns must be excruciating, I hate it when I burn my tongue. I hope they figure out what went wrong. Crazy to think how something so necessary can be so dangerous. ||| I can't imagine what it would be like to live in a war-torn country. Americans have it so much better than they realize and I don't understand why it's so hard for people to put themselves in others' shoes. I feel so much for this poor man that just wanted a peaceful retirement and to hang out with his family and now he and his wife are basically depriving themselves of food so that they have enough for the kids. It's depressing.","It's straight up depressing. ||| I mean, survival instinct is probably a hell of a drug. But I concur. I just picture some sweet old man and his wife in the middle of a warzone, starving themselves to feed the kids. ||| I can hardly imagine working my entire life to provide for my loved ones only to watch it all get flushed down the toilet like that. ||| Right? I feel like medical areas are a generally respected safe zone by both sides, but then again I've never been in war so. ||| I hadn't even heard of this story before this HIT. Ignorance is bliss and all that. ||| Same here - knew about Syria in general but not really anything specific. Except maybe that Canada I think was taking some refugees? ||| Hard agreement there. It's so nuts, like why? If they're in the hospital, they're not coming after anyone. It's horrific. ||| Yeesh, because the people in Aleppos aren't deprived enough already. I mean there's always more to lose. I came here for a good time and now I'm sad. ||| Literally the only thing I have really heard about Syrian refugees is the polarizing arguments on why the US should/shouldn't take them in. Whoever wrote that article is doing good work getting that information out. ||| It is embarrassing! Like look around yourself and see how good you have it! There's so much excess, why is it so hard to share your space with people who are terrified and trying to find sanctuary? ||| You have to do it in all lower case, haha. It's been good talking to you, too! ||| bye ||| I love elephants, that made me so sad to read. ||| They're sweet babies. And I think they're super smart too. I know they are at least very emotionally intelligent. ||| Yeah, they visit each other's graves, which is just heartbreaking. ||| I have no clue. It's a damn shame there isn't more protection around animals in general, legally speaking. ||| They make me sad. I know there are very well maintained zoos, but for the most part they just make me sad. It's one thing if the animals are rescues, I think. ||| Same here. And they charge money for entry on top of it. ||| Or give rides to people. ||| I agree. The internet is a valuable tool used for many of the wrong reasons. ||| Oh my gosh, I know. Zoos make me sad, but Sea World feels like a literal crime. It's a whale. In a pool. Jeez. ||| Probably. The only animals I can think of off the top of my head that don't travel in numbers or aren't social are reptiles. ||| Or they do until they lose interest. I think that was our last one. It was great talking to you! On to the next HIT. Good luck and goodbye ||| I'd be willing to bet the driver that hit that trailer was drunk. Halloween? Yeah. ||| Well I thought it was pretty vague about what actually happened, but like. You don't hit a trailer and be totally lucid. ||| Yeah, doubt that town's going to love celebrating Halloween for a hot minute. Sounds like a small town. Chunky, Missouri ||| Yeah, those kids are going to have a lot of trauma to work through for a long time. ||| Yes, and wild that the husband had died in a car accident earlier in the year I think it was. ||| I've been in a major car accident - no one was hurt, thank god. I don't know how I would have lived with myself if someone had been killed. ||| Well the police they quoted didn't actually give any specifics. They didn't even officially say how many people died, did they? It was very vague. Which is fine because privacy in times of mourning is essential. ||| I just was surprised it went from being as detailed as explaining the girls shoes to barely giving any actual information about what had happened. ||| Most likely, police are probably still investigating the cause of it, as well. ||| Yeah, it's got to be hard to be a small town cop and look at that kind of tragedy. It probably doesn't happen often. ||| Well this has been very depressing. That was our last turn I think though. so goodbye ! ||| I can't fathom just going about my life like those people and then suddenly everything's upside down. ||| I know! Like, burn injuries have to suck to heal, but they made it. ||| Yeah, it said the other two that had injuries were treated on the scene, which is nuts. ||| Meanwhile, I'm reading it and thinking how I'm an infant about burning my tongue or the roof of my mouth, haha. ||| Did the article say where the person who went to the hospital was burned? It was very vague. ||| Probably. I took it to mean they were burned because of the other two people having burns but being treated on scene. ||| Just that the gas to the whole neighborhood got shut off. At first I thought that meant it was the gas that caused it, but thinking about it - seems like a standard operating procedure when there's a huge fire. ||| Yeah. All it said conclusively was that the investigation was ongoing. ||| I don't know if that makes it easier or harder to be empathetic - on the one hand we don't know much. On the other hand, that lets our mind fill in a lot of blanks in ways that may make us feel more sympathetic towards the people involved. ||| You too! goodbye ||| I thought so too ||| I know! like can you imagine turning your back for a second and losing your kid forever? Horrible. ||| I think so, I know the boy was helping harvest vegetables. And the fact that they knew where he was and what happened but just couldn't reach him. So sad. ||| His parents must have been so distressed too. I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him? ||| No, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground. ||| Gah, I can't remember. The only thing I remember that it was only one foot in diameter so that it was too narrow for adults. ||| It said he was three, right? or did it not mention his age? Oh my gosh I can't imagine his little face stop I'm gonna cry ||| I can almost feel the panic of the parents, like the realization of what had happened and the frantic terror. Oh my gosh, goosebumps. ||| I don't know what else to say! this was so sad, like I just want to send a huge frowny face and I wish I could hug his mom. ||| Same here. Good luck with the rest of your day! goodbye"
p009,"Dear friend,I am writing to tell you about a horrific story and article that I have just read. A small two year old boy fell out of his bedroom window and died while his parents thought he was asleep in his room. The window was open and he pushed the screen out and fell and died shortly after. It is such a horrible story. ||| Dear friend,                                                                       I have recently finished reading an article about airstrikes that killed over 40 people and injured many more in Cairo. It is very heartbreaking to hear this news. I feel so bad for the people of the middle east who have to live every day of the their lives scared of missiles and bombs and gunfire. ||| Dear friend,                                          I have recently just read an article about a horrible shooting in Charlotte. It was a black man who was killed by the police. This is just one of many such cases unfortunately. I think there is a problem in this country and I hope that it can be solved one day. ||| Dear friend,                                        I have just read a horrifying and disturbing article about a terror attack that happened in Paris, france in 2015. There were 90 people killed at a rock concert after terrorists opened fire and set of bombs inside of the music venue. This was a truly horrible event. ||| Dear friend,                                                       I have just finished reading an article about Janet Reno. She was the first female US Attorney General. She had a very impressive professional and legal career. I am saddened by her death, she died at the age of seventy eight. She had a productive life. ||| Dear friend,                                                  I have just read an article about Islamic militants who are kidnapping innocent people and using them as human shields. They shoot anyone who refuses to help. The story has made me upset to read. There is so much evil and suffering in the world, I wish it would end. ||| Dear friend,                                                                                    I have just read an article about all of the displaced people in Afghanistan. It is truly saddening. There are over a million people who were forced to leave their homes just in the past year alone. They have no other options, I feel terrible for them. ||| Dear friend,                                                               I have just read an article about the citizens of Aleppo being warned to leave via text message. It is very sad and hard to imagine what it must be like to live in a country like that, where you may be forced to leave at any moment due to acts of violence and war. ||| Dear friend,                                                       I have just finished reading an article about hate crimes against muslims and how they are significantly increasing in recent years. The article was very eye-opening and it made me think. I just wish that everyone could get along with each other. ||| Dear friend,                                                                        I have just read a story about another police officer shooting. These seem to be happening all the time now and it is very upsetting. I hope that one day something can be done about all of this. It is sad to think about . ||| Dear friend,                                                                                          I just read an article about a 70 year old man living in a war torn city in Syria. The story was very sad and has made me think a lot about life. I feel terrible for the people who have to live in those conditions. ||| Dear friend,                                                                                                     I have just finished reading an article about an african elephant named Nosey. She has been held captive for 30 years. It is a very heartbreaking story and it makes me very sad to see her treated this way. ||| Dear friend, I have just finished reading an article that has made me upset. The article was about polar bears and the problems they are facing due to the shorter ice season in recent years. It is very troubling because the bears are suffering and dying due to the shortened ice seasons. I really hope scientists can find a solution soon. ||| Dear friend,                                          I am writing to tell you that I just read a horrifying article about a major 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit New Zealand on Monday. The property damage, loss of life, and injuries are going to be devastating once all the numbers are in. I feel very sickened and saddened after reading this news. ||| Dear friend,                                                                I have just ready a very disturbing story. A young girl in Russia has committed suicide. There are online groups that target young teenagers and kids and encourage them to harm themselves and to commit suicide. It is a very scary and sad thing. ||| Dear friend,                                     I have just read an article that explains how garden ponds are helping to spread diseases among frogs in the UK. The diseases infect frogs and fish as well. It has had a large impact on the local frog population. The story upset me because I don't want any animal to suffer. ||| Dear friend,                                             I have just read an article about the horrible conditions of the syrian people and the refugees who are fleeing the country. I feel awful for these people and would like to find a way to help them at least to be more comfortable. It was a very moving article. ||| Dear friend,                                                                                    I am writing to let you know about an article that I just finished reading. Some anti-poaching rangers were captured by a poacher and attacked by the locals of the village. I feel bad for them, they were just trying to protect the animals. ||| Dear friend,                                                                                                     I have just read an article about a massive fuel leak in British Colombia. It is threatening all of the wildlife in the area, as well as the water. I am worried about this and hope there is a way to stop it before it gets out of hand. ||| Dear friend,     I have just read an article about something that has disturbed me. It is about the water crisis going on in Flint and other places in America. I could not imagine not having access to clean water.                                                                                                                                                 ","I feel awful for them too. I hope scientists are able to fix the problem ||| I don't know, I'm not qualified to answer that - I just hope something can be done for them ||| I agree. I want them to be around for a long time ||| I agree. I don't wish for any creature to suffer or go extinct ||| I agree, but I hope not. hopefully we can rely on a more renewable source of energy soon ||| that is true, still I hope something changes ||| I do what little I can. but of course I still have to use gas to get around and stuff ||| maybe. but now most car manufacturers are making electric vehicles, so in the near future there will be less of a need for gas ||| there are also problems like pollution, especially in India and china ||| they have had to release flesh-eating turtles into the Ganges river to get rid of all of the dead bodies ||| yeah I know, its a huge problem there ||| ok, thanks. have a great rest of your day ||| goodbye ||| hello, what did you think about the article? ||| me either, they must feel awful ||| yeah true i thought the same. or they will have bars to prevent it ||| they will usually have steel bars or something like that in high rises ||| yeah i think i remember reading that they had another child ||| yea true. the parents really should have been more careful, i feel awful for them though ||| yes that is true. i hope they have learned from it ||| i agree with that ||| yeah true im sure that would only add to their misery ||| im going to end the chat now, it was nice talking to you, have a good day. goodbye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| Yes i agree, its very sad ||| it's horrible, we need to stop involving ourselves ||| many cases of that in the middle east ||| too much influence from israel and saudis ||| yes exactly, thats what i was implying ||| sadly i dont think there is anything we can do other than just send them aid ||| thats why i feel like theres really nothing the average person can do ||| it is a sad situation altogether ||| in most cases yes ||| goodbye ||| They are so scary and the destruction is awful ||| yeah and even that sometimes isn't enough ||| I agree. they are very scary and devastating ||| yeah that is sad too, theres no excuse for that ||| i agree. but it is also inspiring to see communities come together and help each other after these terrible events happen ||| im not sure, i dont know much about it. but hopefully eventually all new buildings will be reinforced to withstand them ||| yes it does, but like you said - earthquakes are the most unpredictable and most destructive ||| i agree, and im sure with time we will figure it out ||| volcanoes would be horrifying too, i hope the one in yellowstone doesn't erupt ||| i dont think most people even ever think about it ||| they definitely scare me, lol. it was nice talking to you, have a great day! goodbye ||| i believe you have to say bye, thank you goodbye ||| 7 ||| I think it is horrible ! ||| That does not surprise me, I have seen it in my own life ||| yes unfortunately I do ||| I agree, social media can be extremely harmful ||| Yes I agree. anything that can be done to keep the kids safe ||| I'm not sure entirely but I hope something can be done ||| That would be a good start! ||| I definitely agree with that ||| Perhaps an increase in anti social behaviors ||| im sure it is a mixture of many different factors ||| thank you! goodbye ||| hello, how did you feel about the article?

I dont know what the answer is ||| I wish that there was another way ||| at least a step in the right direction would be nice ||| yeah because there was a whole new problem created by that mass influx a few years ago ||| i think there are problems with both groups.i understand the refugees feeling alienated, but i also understand the europeans being upset over the mass rapings that were happening ||| you can google the rotherham child sex scandal and the 2015–16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany where 1200 german women were raped in one night by a roaming gang of refugees. i just wish everyone could get along ||| I think it would have to begin with a complete overhaul of everything we have now.

Wish all people could get along ||| do you think its just nature? ||| do you think it would be better if people separated themselves into their preferred groups? ||| I think maybe if people were separated and kept to themselves they may get along better. they could still trade and communicate and all of that, but just live in their own spaces ||| I agree but I suppose desperate times... ||| i just wish there was more of a sense of community ||| yeah i think people are becoming desensitized to everything ||| good talking to you, goodbye ||| hello, what di you think about the article? ||| i agree. it happened near where i grew up ||| yeah i agree with that ||| yeah and so does killing yourself after killing other so you dont have to face the punishment ||| i can only imagine ||| about 15 miles from where i grew up ||| i have no idea i dont live there anymore ||| yeah i agree i dont think it was illness ||| im not sure how that is all handled really, would be interesting to find out ||| i think probably not ||| i dont either, especially such a confusing and sad case like this ||| no not really. nice chatting with you, goodbye ||| Yes I agree. feel bad for the rangers and the animals ||| Yeah it could definitely be something like that ||| I agree. Before the animals are all wiped out ||| That isnt suprising. It seems kind of lawless out there ||| yeah they're real big on that. and the rhino horns ||| Well since the science behind is isnt even real, theyd be better off just synthesizing something and selling it as the rhino horn powder ||| I really dont know but i know they dont have any magical power ||| they think they give them sexual powers, lol ||| true but i dont think people take that too seriously here, where as in China they are very serious about it ||| they do cause a lot of pollution lol ||| well i suppose thats good at least ||| yes i agree with that ||| india has bad problems with just trash in general ||| not at all haha. it was nice talking to you! have a good day. goodbye ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| I agree, very sad ||| I know, it would be so awful ||| The part about them rationing food ||| and just living that way while being so elderly ||| yeah neither can I, it must be terrible ||| That would be terrible I dont know if i could do it ||| yeah i cant even imagine@ ||| Theres always something going on over there unfortunately ||| yeah i could see that happening as well ||| sure, but i do need to leave here soon! ||| goodbye! ||| Hello, what did you think of the story? ||| i know :( and the physical toll it's taken on her body ||| i hope someone is able to rescue her ||| me too and they are very common ||| i dont know how she hasnt been taken from her owner yet ||| i have no idea but they obviously dont do a good job ||| i hope they are able to get her into an elephant sanctuary ||| yeah there is definitely some corruption going on ||| yeah definitely. especially sad it is happening here in the US ||| i did think that until i had read through the text a second time, lol ||| i agree. it was nice talking to you today! goodbye ||| i agree, what a waste and a danger to the wildlife ||| i agree. i can imagine it would be difficult to clean up ||| i agree, they are not to blame ||| i'm not too familiar with how things work up there ||| i wonder if they are still able to use the gas after they remove it fromthe water ||| definitely. best case is the marine life is saved and the fuel is saved too, lol ||| i'm not sure either, never been much of a seafood fan myself ||| i really dont know. hopefully it isnt a lingering problem in the area ||| i had not heard of it until this ||| yeah that makes sense. nice talking to you! goodbye ||| i agree, it is awful ||| i dont think so after this whole ordeal ||| i think so too. i hope not ||| i have no idea. need more transparency ||| at this point i think they should step in ||| normally i'd say otherwise ||| it has been going on for a long time too ||| me too and could potentially cause more damage later in life ||| i really hope they figure it out son ||| nice talking to you. goodbye"
p010,"I just read the article about Aleppo and Syria.   It made me extremely sad to see what these people have gone through.   They have worked hard their whole lives for betterment of their family.   Now they just pray bombs or airstrikes doesn't kill their families.   Is war ever going to end?   The answer to that is a simple no.   Humans have been killing humans since they existed.   We never, ever learn. ||| Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. ( ||| Hey A:   Did you read the article where all those children were killed on the roadway and the many injuries that took place?   Kids were in a trailer and a truck plowed into the back of them.  It was extremely disturbing to read.  I could just visualize the pain, suffering, and panic that was taking place.    I can't imagine losing 2 of your own children.  Further reading showed the driver had lost her husband.  Whoever was driving the truck will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  It's extremely sad. ||| I read the article on the China mining disaster.   There were 33 miners trapped in the mine.  Only two of them survived.  Officials stated whoever was responsible would be punished.   Smaller mines were shut down immediately until further notice.   China has always been known for the deadliest mining.   ||| I just finished reading the UW-Madison article.  This guy named Alec Cook is being charged in alleged attacks on 5 women.   It was a gruesome article how he forced these women to have sex with him or drugged and raped them despite the women pleading no.   Stories like this really affect everyone.  It's quite horrendous to think this happens so much in our culture.   His legal team has a great deal to disprove.   ||| It's the 21st century and we have barely moved women.   USA has slipped to 45th and we have African countries ahead of us.   For the past 100 years, it's all politics and government and who is going to win.  Definitely not for equality or fairness to genders.  I had a job in career that compared identically to a man's and he was paid 40% more than me.   You can't express it or you get fire because almost every state is an at-will state. ||| Food waste in the United States is just shameful.   So many children and adults are hungry, yet we have learned nothing.   There are some companies that were established solely for people to drop off uneaten food or expired food.   There are few places anywhere you can take large amounts of food to redistribute.    ||| This story is very very sad.   it seems almost every day and family member kills their entire family.   This article was distressing to read - their little girl had so many health problems.   The mom had PTSD.  Friends and relatives relayed they were great people.   Facebook indicates a wonderful life.  They are gone from this world and none of us know what happened behind closed door.    ||| Reading this article on contaminated water is mind-boggling.   The work is done, reports are made, violations noted, and no one assesses any penalties.  Ludicrous!   Why do any of the work if nothing is done with the findings.  What other profession allows this!   Our government is ridiculous.   We need more Erin Brockovich's in this world to fine these folks millions and millions of dollars in fine.  I worry about our children. ||| Why isn't the EPA assessing fines for violations?   So presently you just get a violation but no repercussions.   Another example of ridiculous wasted government who sits on their behinds and doesn't do their job.   I feel every year we need a completely new group of employees in every division in the government.   It's ridiculous.   The next most treasured commodity will be clean water everywhere.  ||| In the 21st century, people are still starving after major disasters.   This earthquake destroyed Haiti and in my opinion, there was not enough food that was brought in from other countries.   I constantly wonder how this continues to be such a slow, slow process.   I have been to Haiti and the country is hard enough just to live without major catastrophic disasters. ||| Sally Brampton dies at age 60 from suicide.   Another life lost due to the convoluted medical care mess.   It makes me extremely sad.   I, too, have suffered from dark depression for the last 10 years.  I think daily it would be awesome to die.  Medications do not work for me.   I was born this way and people who know nothing about the intricacies of this terrible disease do not understand.  It's our wiring and absolutely nothing helps when you have had it your entire life.  You are exhausted. ||| This is the saddest article ever.   All these beautiful Savannah Elephants being called for the ivory.I absolutely do not support killing any elephant for any reason.   I do not support elephants in circuses either.   As long as their are humans, this will sadly continue.   Everyone is me, me, me.  I hope huge fines as assessed. ||| This French article was so distressing.  Bullying is by far the worst I have seen in my lifetime.  For it be so bad, you feel there is nothing left to do but kill yourself is a massive failure of all those who knew Emilie and did absolutely nothing.   I respect her mom for telling her story in hopes that it comforts others who are thinking the same thing.  Two girls lost for what? ||| This was a difficult article to read.   I cannot image the weight on the parents souls carrying this one action the rest of their lives.   They put him to bed, window was  most likely open for fresh air, and the little boy with his curiosity pushed the screen and fell.   Whew, hard to comprehend.  I wish nothing but grace from God to ease the parents suffering. ||| All the poor animals that died in that zoo.   They starved to death.   They are known for the worst zoo ever.   Why would you have such a distinctive zoo and then let the animals starve.  Weren't there gatekeepers of the zoo while the military conflict took place.  They even fed them occasionally with chickens which is a no no.   (: ||| Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton was slightly interesting.   They met on a set and married for two years.  Thornton was not a fan of the craziness she brought to his quiet, reserved world.   He never felt good enough he said.  Even with great success and notoriety still comes down to \less than\"" perfect lives and self worth.  "" ||| This is the saddest story ever.   Why would a police officer leave his dog in a car on a hot day where he dies?   You just don't leave a dog in a car for 1 full day without knowing it.   I am glad he's on paid leave.   The dog was three years old.   In my opinion, it's intentional and there needs to be ramifications.   ||| Hey A, Have you read the article this morning regarding gruesome stabbing of a Manhattan partygoer?   They found him (Joseph Comunale) on Jersey Shore buried in a one foot deep grave stabbed 15 times and partially burned. (:.   To top off the horrendous event, Comunale who was a celebrity jeweler, one of the suspects was his surrogate son.   He took him in and found a job for him and was always there.  Sex is the unofficial charge of why he was murdered.   This is very disturbing to me.   I do not understand how anyone could be so brutal and evil.   I can't quit thinking about how his life ended.   It's a sad, sad story. ||| A very disturbing article about animal abuse of an elephant.   The USDA had multiple fines, violations, etc. that were filed in favor of Nosey the elephant.   They have done absolutely nothing.  This is exactly why no one likes any division of the US government.   They have thousands of pages of forms you must complete and then they just sit on them and make no action.   It's very disturbing Nosey has had a difficult life which humans are responsible for.   ||| I could barely read about the fiery crashes and fatalities.  One family had already suffered loss earlier in the year.   Anytime children are involved it seems even more severe and horrendous.   I do wonder why someone had a trailer with children in it and driving it down the highway.   What could have been a wonderful Halloween ended up entirely different and a tragic evening that will never be forgotten. ||| This article on Kenya and South Sudan is so sad.   Africa has had various rules for thousand of years that look out for no one but themselves except Nelson Mandella who went to prison for all the right things.   The UN does more harm than good.   How do you look at a whole nation as one individual?  It's a war torn country and my heart breaks for them.   ||| Hey A:  Did you read the article on cholera in third world countries?  I'll focus on the Haiti piece of the article.   Haiti had an overwhelming number of folks that had cholera.   Vaccines were offered to the government because there was little they could do for those folks other than IVs.   The government refused to take help from the World Health Organization.   The corruption that goes on that country never ceases to amaze me.   I got extremely frustrated reading what could have been done but nothing was done.   So many people died that should not have.   ||| Haiti goes from one catastrophe to another.   If it isn't a life ending hurricane, it's cholera.   I have huge respect for Bill and Melinda Gates.   Vaccines will stop cholera.  This country's opinions of vaccines are assine.   Without vaccinations, we return to cholera, small pox, measles, etc.   People wanting vaccines to save their lives yet there are not enough.   ||| This girl's life is forever changed.  Pellets destroyed her eyes and her face.   Her mom wraps scarves around her face and eyes to protect her.  :)   I have a great deal of admiration for her as she is speaking the the journalist about what happened.   She wants her government to give her an answer.  She had aspirations of becoming a doctor.   She showed her textbooks to him.   She is in and out of hospitals hoping to retain her eyesight.    ||| This story in Caphiridzange is horrific.   The tanker just pulled over to provide fuel to the residents of that region and it completely blew up hurting countless numbers of people.   There were a couple of ideas that were suggested what caused it but nothing was specific.   So many died and so many left injured.    ||| This fire in the Arizona complex was so very scary.   The entire building was a complete loss.   It was great that the firemen rescued almost all of them without injuries except one that was sent to a burn unit.   Watching all your possessions and your home burn is just very sad.  I can't imagine replacing everything.   ||| I really doubt the credibility of anything China says.   They are always out for money, workers are in jobs that aren't save, people have no decisions made on their own.  It's a communist country where the government rules.   Living conditions are terrible and I don't believe the branch of government that is responsible for safe working conditions do anything.   It's all just chatter for the rest of the world to rread. ||| This little boy died in a well while he was helping his father harvest vegetables.  It was large enough for him to fall only one foot but too small for all the adults.  They tried to get him out for five days.  His father had to entail that severe pain knowing it was just time.   Over 500 volunteers tried to dig him out to get to the well.  Just devastating. ||| This is a topic that never seems to get any better for women.   Pay inequality has dropped to 45 for the United States.  This is an embarrassing statistic.   Fewer women are in the workforce and fewer women hold prestigious jobs.   The misuse of women's education and value is so disheartening.  US Stem Skills professions are not in a good place. Scandinavian countries hold the top 4 spots.  The disparity in salaries is what it was in 2008.   ||| The depravity that goes on in this world is alarming at best.   At Busch Gardens, Joseph Anthony Corrao, picked up a flamingo named Pinky and threw her to the ground.   Her injuries were so bad that she was euthanized.   Pinky was famous for a dance she just did on her own and welcomed visitors sometimes.    ||| What is human nature coming to?   Zoo visitors attacking the wildlife and inflicting such horrendous injuries that she had to be put down.   I can't imagine what in the world that would cause a human being to do that.   His bond was too low.   It should be very high.   Laws are so ridiculous.   We do the laws that should not be on the books.    ||| Another article about politics slamming one side or the other.   The article refers to America has to heal.   The only way it can heal is people have to quit thinking about me, me, me, and look out for the nation and others.   It seems it just comes down to what vitriol will be posted to some social media site.  People are numb to all of it yet all the national media continues to support one side or the other and not see it as what it is.  ","It's very sad.   I can't believe in the 21st century that people are still so slow in helping third world countries or even in the US when New Orleans was destroyed.   It makes no sense. ||| And food - you can get by in Haiti without much shelter but one must have clean water and food to live ||| I have not but I have been to Haiti on a mission trip.   Such wonderful kind people. ||| That would be so much stress.   I live in Colorado so just beautiful white snow. ||| I have been near tornadoes and they look bad enough.  I can't imagine a hurricane. ||| I follow college basketball like a crazy person.   Skal Labiesse was trapped in the hurricane in this article.   His whole home collapsed on him and he was covered with rock and materials for three days.   His story is so frightening.   He thought he was dying ||| Wow.   Are you on the gulf or the Atlantic? ||| That's good to hear.   Haiti has such a corrupt government - I wonder how much their President stole from the people so he had fun for a long time. ||| It's gotten to that point everywhere unless a church is doing all the work.   American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, United Way - hardly any goes to the people or cause you are donating to - it's all taken in outlandish salaries of that charity ||| You too goodbye ||| It made me very sad.   She had such a hard life.   Whether it's socialized medicine or medicine here in the states, they miss so much with mental illness. ||| We aren't.   I am so tired of physicians sending you to a therapist to talk about your childhood or given medicine that doesn't work.   No one listens to the patient at all. ||| Yes!   I have suffered from dark depression my entire life.   It has nothing to do with your childhood.   You were wired that way at birth.   To date, physicians are just initially tapping how to help people.    Such a long way to go. ||| Oh it is.   Your family doesn't know how to help.   I just stay exhausted and really never socialize.   It really has nothing for therapists to address.   They can help victims of assault, etc. but they do not help for depression.   At least, that's been the case for me.    I'm sorry you suffer from it. ||| Just know I totally understand.   From personal experience, I think anxiety and depression go hand and hand.   I have a lot of anxiety around people or social settings.   What about you? ||| No - they just look at you with that pitiful look and once employers know they look for ways to terminate you - if you had cancer everyone is supportive. ||| And your point is exactly why none of us want to convey we have it.   To your point, we are all crazy. ||| We are - the thing we have to come to agreement on is how do we not feel like we can't do anything all the time.   I don't ever get a break from those feelings. ||| It was nice chatting with you.    goodbye ||| It made me very sad.  All those beautiful Savannah Elephants slaughtered for ivory. ||| I swear human beings are the worst.  It's me, me, me, me.   They should be assessed astronomical finds and prison time. ||| Yes it would.   I live in Colorado so bears, elk, and mountain lions are everywhere.   Stupid people come to Colorado with no knowledge of large animals.   Then they get attacked, etc. and the Department of Wildlife  has to kill the animal.   Makes me so mad. ||| What else really caught your attention in the article? ||| I know.   I really was thinking about what could be done and how could it be tracked?   I couldn't think of anything. ||| It just seems the head of animals (I don't know the proper term) knows how the whole process works and could implement something.   I'm sure people are paid off etc. ||| Has to be - If you are facing prison time in Africa not the US and excessive monetary penalties, that possibly could reduce it ||| Not that I am aware of - I was hoping the article had a brief narrative regarding that instead of all the %s. ||| The solution could be stop making things that are ivory.   If no one uses it,  less elephants would be killed.   Piano keys etc. could be made out of something differently. ||| Enjoyed chatted goodbye ||| Bullying is a worldwide problem.   Reading that two young girls felt there was no reason to live was very sad to me. ||| Social media is a huge component of teen suicides.   Parents are allowing their children to have access to things they are not mentally prepared for at alarming levels. ||| Exactly.   Many studies have already been done that kids shouldn't be on social media.   Their frontal cortex is not prepared for all they experience.  Once you see it, you can't unsee it. ||| It certainly can.  You always here the old \I need to contact them.  They may need me.\""   Well youngsters aren't by themselves.  They always have an adult.   Call the school office if you need something or vice versa.   It worked that way for 2010 years."" ||| I did.  My family lived on a farm.  The city kids always made fun of the country kids.   How parents allow their kids to be so mean - I will never understand.   Many parents need parenting classes before they have kids.   It's like I see nothing, I hear nothing mentality.   Such a disservice.   Were you bullied? ||| It's alarming to the level it has gotten.   It weighs on your soul.   Middle school and high school are the worst in my opinion. ||| Too many hormones kicking in.    Did bullying affect your opinion of yourself? ||| Same here.   I have had lifetime effects from a self-esteem point.   The old bullying adage of you are stupid, you are ugly, etc.  has lasting effects ||| They do.   What about you? ||| We didn't have the tools to do so younger.  Do overs are always better results.  It's been very nice chatting with you.    goodbye ||| It was so very sad.   Those poor parents. ||| I doubt he felt anything.  Most of the time it is just quick.   Leaving a window opened for fresh air definitely was not intentional ||| It's always easy to see what should have been done.  Parents work, cook, clean, take care of kids, etc.   Possibly they could have seen whether it was easy to push out though.   Kids are climbers.  Mine certainly never stayed in their crib. ||| Definitely.  As long as they have renters, they may clean the carpet and that's about it. ||| I know.  I felt for the people that were outside and found him. ||| Exactly.  If I run up on a wreck with fatalities, it's devastating ||| Agreed and what surgeons see.  God bless them all ||| and they should.   I do feel like the apartment owner is at fault though.  It won't bring the little boy back but it may help others ||| Exactly.   I have never seen a little one die.  (: ||| agreed.  well it was nice chatting with you.   Have a good day goodbye ||| I am not a supporter of zoos or circuses.   Wild animals were not met to be captured and put in a small area so humans can take pictures ||| It seems every day you pick up a newspaper or see it on TV where another animal was starved or not taken care of in zoos and circuses.   All for the $.  I live in Colorado and there's a wildlife viewing area.   There are 6,000 acres and animals roam freely.   I \sort\"" of think that's okay but you are still taking them out of their natural habitat."" ||| Oh my!  I could talk for days.  I live in the mountains.   There are bears, mountain lions, foxes, elk, bison, and deer to name a few.  They freely roam through our downtown, on the highways, etc. and we allow them to be wild.   We then have people come in from everywhere that no nothing about wildlife and provoke the animals for photos are whatever.  The animal charges, hurts the individual and then Department of WIldlife has to put it down (: ||| I know.  There are lots of protests going on here about not doing that - we will see.   This article we read was crazy even to think about opening a new zoo there. ||| Me either and why they would think this zoo was going to be anything different is beyond me. ||| It is a blessing - I always wonder who people that do it know where it is taking place - dolphins, elephants, whales, etc.   People abuse all over the world but there are folks somewhere that try to help ||| We all get caught up in working, cooking, cleaning, taking kids everywhere, and getting some sleep - it's very hard.  You almost have to carve out a time everyday whether early morning or before you go to bed to get caught up ||| And even animals like horses are mistreated - starved because they do not have money for hay.   Please sell - don't let them just die ||| what in the world is happening there?  What is wrong with their track that 30+ horses have died ||| you would think there's a governing agency that would look out for the horses.  Minimal shutdown and $ became more important ||| It never changes.  It was nice chatting about this sad article and the other items that were relative.  Many blessings to you and yours.  goodbye ||| Hi!   I am doing well!  Thanks for asking.   It was an interesting article.   What are your thoughts? ||| That's me :)   I just saw even with success and notoriety - there are those that can't find peace.  He felt he wasn't good enough. ||| No it isn't.   Her world was crazy and she liked it - His world was quiet, reserved, and didn't like partying with the reach.    It \appeared\"" they had nothing in common at all"" ||| I know and it's folks you would not think about making it that long.   Jolie seems to go after men in movies they are together so she shouldn't be married in my opinion ||| They aren't - a few are - Newman gives back - Bullock gives back etc.  Most just want to show off fancy houses, cars, etc.   1 in 5 kids are hungry - how much money does one need? ||| Me either.  All the young people nowadays have every waking moment documented.  It will haunt them at some point ||| And all the selfies.  How many photos do you want of yourself?  I don't get wanting to photos of yourself at all.   It's a disturbing behavior. ||| It just continues the downhill path of me, me, me.  It needs to get back to we, we, we. ||| It's all these electronic devices that we don't need.  It has made life more complicated that it needs it to be.   On a side note, when you take these hits, what are all the emotions based on - it never says.    Does it mean how I am feeling generally or how the story made me feel? ||| Me too.  It's a refreshing change.   I can't thank you enough for chatting today.  Blessings to you and yours.   goodbye ||| What did you think of this article? ||| Same here.   All I can picture was the 70 year old man saddened and weak.   Everything he worked so hard for was gone and he had to stay. ||| I know.   I volunteer at an at-risk youth center in the city.   The majority of the kids I work with are refugee families.   We have no idea how blessed we are. ||| These youth are from Syria, Jordan, Sudan, Ethiopia.   They all came from the countries this story is conveying. ||| Not so much anger but more TBI symptoms.   I had to take a lot of classes to understand it in order to be able to work with them.   No one know except them the impact of years of bombing and homes being burned how that permanently affects children. ||| Another dark part of refugees relocating is there is no one keeping these families together.   Some are here in US, the same family has members in Canada or Brazil.   It's bazaar. ||| To me everything is simple.   Example:   US can take 2000 refugees this year.   Why not take a whole family at a time to get to the 2000 ?   It's not rocket science.   My imagination is are they saying you, you, you get to go??? ||| Well I didn't either until I started volunteering.   Most come here with absolutely nothing especially shoes.  They walked barefoot for smiles and smiles.   When they finally get here, they have flip flops that were given to them.   I live in Colorado so we have 9 months of snow each year.   I head up a Christmas Shoe sponsorship where families adopt a child and the main purpose is to give them a sturdy pair of athletic shoes.    If they want to give something else, perfectly fine.   We give photos to the families and their children get involved after they see their sweet faces. ||| Yes so far I have 560 sponsors.   I still need 20 more for kids and 100 for the adults.  I'll get it.      If you haven't worked as a volunteer to help these folks, I highly recommend.   The parents cannot speak English so the children never have anyone to help them at home.   Tutoring brings them joy as well as you feel like you helped them. ||| It's most everywhere that has a city.  Mine is in Denver - but the refugees are located in most all cities in the US.    It was so nice chatting with you about this topic.   Blessings to you and your family,  goodbye ||| Hello ||| It is so very terrible.    Between people leaving their kids in a car and animals, a greater punishment is needed for it to stop. ||| I just do not think you leave a large animal in a vehicle and never see it or it barking continuously. ||| Where was he for 38 hours that he would not have come back to the car?  I agree.  Police have procedures for everything. ||| Oh I thought the dog was 5 years old and he had been a handler for 3 years? ||| It was 38 and I just do not believe you leave him in the car.   With all the media hysteria, he can't hide for sure. ||| Sounds like sick of the dog.  Just tie him up outside.   I can't relate honestly ||| They are not easy to come by.  My son-in-law is a Seal and had difficulty in obtaining well trained dogs ||| Absolutely correct.   I know we are suppose to write 10 sentences each but I am running out of comments ||| I had a dog that we all loved so very much.   His name was Blackie.   We had a visitor and their little boy was \teasing\"" him with a stick and he snipped at him.   My dad said if a dog bites once he will bite again and he gave him away.  I do not know if that is correct but we were devastated."" ||| Yes it is.   Well according to the instructions I am leaving the chat with a lower case word.  Then you said it lower case and answer the exit question.   It has been a pleasure today.   goodbye ||| I agree - no way you just leave a dog in a car and forget about him.   What a horrible way for the dog to die (: ||| Hard for me to even begin to know what that looks like.  There was another case as well ||| Me either - I don't believe any of the cases where children or animals are left in cars to die is an accident ||| It's horrendous.   Absolutely nothing is done for the most of them.   It's as if children's lives mean absolutely nothing.   Common sentences are community service are 18 months in jail with 6 mos suspended etc. ||| It's very crazy.   It makes me so mad every time I hear nothing has been done.   It's the same with children that are killed in violence.   What's the difference between a child and an adult when it's willful? ||| Agreed.    Harming animals intentionally is a psychopath in the making ||| I agree.   It seems like the world has changed so much but it probably hasn't.   We just have 24/7 news coverage on a loop. ||| Social media is a dark place.   This upcoming generation of children are being seriously harmed and parents are clueless ||| I did not let my daughter have a phone until she was a freshman in college.   My daughter is not allowing her two daughters/my granddaughters have it until then either.   She is considering a flip phone for home use only that she can only call on -  nothing else.  Proud of her for that. ||| Absolutely.   She currently is running a chapter for parents to see what all psychologists have already reported.   Their frontal cortex is not read to see what you see.   You can't unsee it.    Kids are committing suicide because of bullying.   They are all obsessed with \friends\"" likes and thinking what is posted is their real life.   It's all a fraud"" ||| I am so sorry to hear that - I hope she's doing better.   Heck, even as a middle aged person you see photos of a party or something and think why wasn't I invited.   I can't even imagine what a kid would think ||| same here.   goodbye ||| Same thing with computers.   Old days it was simple.  Now you have to do 4x the work to enter what the computers say.    I did find it interesting that both Rackover and Dilione had their heads hung very low when they were charged.   Body language says a lot.  I would love to see expressions and listen to their statements to see if you can detect a lie. ||| None.   I know we have to do at least 10 turns and we can earn more.  What's your interest? ||| I think it sways the jurors to a guilty verdict.   Sex and partying got out of hand so IT has to be him........  I do not buy the sex piece.   They knew each other too long for that. ||| No one deserves rape.   It's the only criminal offense that I can think of that always blames the victim because of previous six life, provocative clothing, etc.   It has nothing to do with the crime.   Victim is used a great deal in court - both sides play it. ||| I am a firm believer you have to pass a test to be a juror.   This article made me think a great deal about what Comunal was feeling when his surrogate son was stabbing him. ||| That's right! ||| He obviously had no morals or remorse about anything. ||| You are exactly right.  It's not easy anymore.   It's been very nice chatting with you.  I did the other Empathic Conversation a couple of days ago.  Whoever it was had not read it, so it was hard completing it.   Enjoy MTurking!   Don't forget to include the word goodbye when you receive this!  Goodbye! ||| It's sad.   USDA had all the violations - more than 200 and did nothing.   Do you go to zoos or circuses? ||| We do.   There is a huge one in Denver.   My granddaughters enjoy it - it is a zoo where animals have large spaces and not a little cage.  I have mixed emotions though.   Never a circus - are there any that do not mistreat animals? ||| Agreed.   They are hit and beat and put in small trailers carting them from one city to the next.   It's cruel. ||| Agreed.   Nosey had so many medical conditions and no one cared.  All about the money.  (: ||| They seem to be.   I always wanted to go to Africa to see them in their natural habitat but it's a trip I will never be able to afford. ||| I just know it would be.   If I could do it in conjunction with helping the children there to learn how to read, i would be ecstatic! ||| We have a local church that goes on several mission trips.   It's large enough to help most people.   I haven't been able to find other ways to finance it.   I work with refugee families here in Denver that were relocated to us because of the violence and wars in their regions.   I love all of them so much. ||| I hope so.    Their stories are so sad but they are bright, happy children.   Several from the regions of Africa really brighten up when they share the animals they saw there and how they protected themselves.   It really isn't like we all imagine. ||| It changes how you feel and how you live.   For that, I am eternally grateful. ||| It was nice speaking to you.   goodbye ||| It was so sad.   What started as a Halloween adventure turned to fire and tragedy.   It was hard to read. ||| I know.  I didn't understand the dad pulling a trailer of kids??? ||| I guess.  A trailer full of kids (:    They would have been safer if they were just riding in the back of the truck - maybe would have been thrown out? ||| Oh I get it.  I grew up in a rural community.  One time about 40 of us got into a cattle truck and drove to Kings Island in Cincinnati.  That was back in the day but now that I'm grown I think ooh not a great decision ||| I know.   lol   We played board games, sang, acted ridiculous and had a blast.  Once we got there, Dad had a ladder that we all climbed out.  People were astonished :) ||| I know.   I hate all this social media.   All people do is have their heads buried in their phones oblivious to the beautiful world around us. ||| So agree.   I have pretty much gotten off my phone.   It's addictive and I do not like addictive behaviors. ||| Oh I know - I do not see how first responders deal with all the horrible things happening.  You can't unsee it once you see it. ||| I know.   I am thankful that all these folks help in tragedies and are there for the families. ||| Nice talking with you goodbye ||| This story was so very sad and tragic.  It was hard to read. ||| Politics? ||| Mine was about children killed on Halloween night by a truck.  How does this happen? ||| I know.   Husband had died away a bit ago and now two children.   Very tough.  Should we talk about that one in our chat since I have not read yours?  This is crazy. ||| I know.  I would love to know what happened to the driver of the truck.  It leaves you hanging for sure. ||| No.  They were just traveling with all those kids in a trailer and boom!  The truck rammed into the back of them.   It does say by the skid marks on the road that it was easy to draw a police diagram. ||| I am going to what happens in most wrecks.   Too distracted eating, texting, talking on the phone, or fiddling with the radio. ||| I know.  The driver of the kids was at fault as well in my opinion.  Why are there kids in a trailer that you are pulling? ||| Very, very reckless.    Mine are always buckled even when they cry \I don't want to\""  :)"" ||| I would guess that both will have assigned responsibilities.  She would definitely be charged with child endangerment. ||| You too bye.  goodbye. ||| It's sad.   The corruptness and unjustness that goes on there has been going on for hundreds of years.  (: ||| Only reason I know some is I help refugee families here that were torn away from their homes.   I tutor the little ones who know little English. ||| Exposure to tutors is about all they get in learning English because they are 1st generation.  Parents can't help. ||| I teach several from South Sudan.   So many sad stores.   I loved Haiti - I went on a mission trip once.  It was a life changing experience.  You really don't think about \things\"" and the same way of living life anymore."" ||| We all do until we make a decision to go and help underdeveloped, tyranical countries. ||| That just makes my skin crawl.    It's like some nations are full of nothing but evilness. ||| Absolutely!   Always a dictatorship and corrupt government.   Only honesty and humanity in leaders was Nelson Mandella. ||| Amazing man.   I saw a documentary on him once he got out of prison.   It was so moving - no dry eyes here.   Poor Haiti has never had a leader who cared about the people.   Just about palaces and stuff. ||| Agreed but who does that?   They are either killed, families threatened, etc. if someone does try to do the wrong thing.   I do not know the answer. ||| You too.   goodbye ||| It made me very frustrated on how governments can withhold medical treatment from people.  It's their choice (or should be) whether to accept it or not. ||| Exactly.  It gave them a 50-65% to live. ||| I learned that President Polk died from it.   Folks studied New York outbreaks and found it was from one place. ||| The article stated late 1800s but I can't remember the year from the article.  I didn't know it was ever in the US ||| Exactly.   Folks in 3rd world countries have no clean water anywhere and aren't educated enough to know what to do.   I thought the Bill and Melinda Gates reference was a great testament in how they give back because of their success. ||| Agreed.  What I didn't come away with is why the WHO is so difficult to get things passed when it comes to deadly diseases.  It's very antiquated. ||| Absolutely should.   What else surprised you in the article? ||| I just wonder if it has been effective.   The world is past another pandemic of some sort.  It's coming but I do not think CDC or WHO are ready if it happens. ||| And society has reached a point where lives would be lost in getting the vaccine or medication.  It would be mass chaos around the world because there are so many more people. ||| I have actually been to Haiti on a mission trip.  It has forever changed my life's approach ||| Of course, Port Au Prince always needs help.  It really makes you tearful.   I went on a mission where there were many illnesses in the mountains.   No stores, little clean water, and bartering for what you needed.   There were so many sick people they lined up at 4:30 in the morning when the sun came up and stayed until sunset.   There was no electricity. ||| I believe so.  When there are no bathroom facilities and tarantulas everywhere, most folks say no.   The people there were so gracious.  They have to garden their own food and have a few chickens so food is very scarce; yet, they wanted to prepare a dinner for us. ||| They are missing out on a beautiful, giving experience.   I really do not have any other comments on the article I read but we have to keep going.   I always wonder why there aren't more Bill and Melinda Gates in the world.  Everything is centered around me, me, me. ||| Yes.  It was a pleasure chatting with you in regard to the cholera article.  I will now say \Goodbye\"""" ||| Goodness, if Haiti doesn't have one huge catastrophic loss, they move to another (: ||| It is.   People in the US fighting against vaccines are uneducated in my opinion.   I hope I didn't offend. ||| So many life changing events to think of.   Bill and Melinda Gates have been such a giving couple of what they saved over the years.   I can't imagine not having enough cholera vaccines for all the habitants. ||| I believe we need to help everyone and not waste money on useless government positions.   It's not just Flint needing clean water.   Half of Kentucky has unclean water due to destroying water supplies by coal companies. ||| exactly - half of that runs into the primary source.   Reclamation bonds are not high enough.  If it were millions and millions of dollars, they would restore the land but they just walk away and leave a destroyed piece of the earth. ||| They were.  I am white but we actually destroyed a nation of people that lived here first and took everything from them.   It makes me sad. ||| well all that is being changed by the PC society.   If I were Native American, I would be proud of that as well.       I know some lovely Haitians that have citizenship.   I don't know what the answer is to get them settled.  Every time money is given, the President takes it and it never gets to the people. ||| It started when man was created and has never stopped.  It never will unfortunately.   Greed, power, money..... ||| lol - I hear you but at least we have something to pay a few bills ||| It was so nice chatting with you today.   Blessings to you and yours.   goodbye ||| It was sad.   It seems all these articles are so very sad. ||| Yes - it makes no sense.   Her mom takes such good care of her.  She covers her face with scarves and is trying so hard for her daughter to be able to see again. ||| It sure is.  Not sure I could do that.  When the journalists met with her, she showed him all the textbooks.  She wanted to become a doctor. ||| It seems Kashmir and many other countries live a hard life of war ||| It sure does.   I am always so grateful of where I was born.   You are where you are born. ||| Agreed.  One's whole life is just where you were born into - good or bad.   I wonder if this girl will get her eyesight back. ||| Agreed.  I hope she does get to ask someone why.   That was important to her. ||| Yes hopefully. ||| I don't.   They  have been fighting for thousands of years.   Some countries will just never be better due to corruption ||| It was nice chatting with you.   goodbye ||| It was so sad and horrific.  Your? ||| I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it. ||| I live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary. ||| We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away. ||| I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina? ||| That's good - are you a UNC basketball fan? ||| I love any kind of basketball!    I am a KY wildcat fan.   I went to Vegas a couple of years ago and KY placed UNC.   Daggum Roy :) ||| It said 19 but they expected to find more charred bodies.   What a terrible way to die - I think it would be horrific ||| I can't even go there - not sure what is worse - fire or drowning - I think fire would be quicker ||| Me too - it was nice chatting with you today - goodbye ||| It was sad.   I was just glad to see that only one person was hurt and had to go to the hospital ||| I can't imagine what they feel watching their home and all the contents perish. ||| I wonder what caused it - no reference of anything in the article ||| Me too - it was like - here's the fire that destroyed everything - and not much else ||| Agreed - articles tend to be either so very long and technical I get lost or so short you really do not know what the intent was in the written piece. ||| Just sensationalism - it's why I don't follow the news anymore - it's slanted and full of errors.  It's just all opinions - I don't care what opinion the journalist has - just interview and write it accordingly ||| I know - Tom Brokaw was my favorite - he wrote a book titled \The Greatest Generation\"".   t was so well written.   Social Media is the worst thing ever"" ||| or bully people all day long.  Little 10 year olds committing suicide - and where are the parents - why does a 10 year old have access to social media - insance ||| it's just sad ||| Agreed - seldom are their exit plans in apartment complexes ||| Yes it was - have a good day - goodbye ||| 2815897278 ||| Yeah, I can't imagine what it must have been like for the families waiting for them to be dug out of what ended up being their tomb. ||| I don't think that mining will ever be considered a \safe\"" profession. Accidents happen."" ||| Slowly asphyxiating would be a horrible way to go, but with 33 people breathing they probably didn't have to wait long/ ||| The weight of what little hope they had to see their loved one alive again must have been difficult to bear. ||| Have you ever experienced the death of a loved one? ||| I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my best friend of 17 years at 22. My parents and grandparents are all still living and healthy. ||| We try to get together often. Did the article mention what they were actually mining for? ||| It mentioned that they used ventilation fail safes to keep gas pockets from forming in the mines. Do you know how something like that works? ||| I wonder what the average age of a Chinese miner is. ||| Unfortunately, it usually takes tragedies like this for safety and procedure to be altered and followed more closely. Thanks for chatting today. bye ||| I do not believe anything China says about investigating.   All workers are in unsafe working environments ||| It sure is - people die in China all the time - the little statement about the mines etc. completely for the rest of the world to see ||| They do - Sometimes I think China is worse than Russia in regard to communism ||| Agreed - all this NBA stuff about China is alarming ||| Yes all kinds of drama.   One tweet set it all off.   Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong.    It was all about China's counter-extremism where 2 million are forced into re-education camps.  Insane. ||| Me either.  It's horrendous.    Why in the 21st century is this still going on?   Millions of people in a state they can never leave ||| Absolutely nothing.   Their governments need to be overthrown.   People deserve a chance ||| We did it with Middle East. ||| Going back to the article, I would think dying in a mine would be long and slow (: ||| goodbye ||| This article was very difficult for me to read.  So much of it was horrendous. ||| Well me too with all that came forward.  There are few times when someone is accused not to be guilty. ||| I have no inkling why men rape women.  There are many who willingly want to do that.  I know people say it's power.  That still makes no sense. ||| I found it odd the article including nothing about what UW-Madison was doing, investigating, policies, etc. ||| Look at all that went on at Michigan State University and as far as I know nothing has happened. ||| It is.  Kansas has been the same way - just excuse it all.   I found it interesting how first the legal team was saying innocent until proven guilty but clammed up when the additional ones came forward.  It then became no comment. ||| He preyed on so many.   Drugs, social media, consensual, non-consensual, etc.  It seemed everyone was a target. ||| Me too.   I so feel for the victims and what they will carry forever. ||| Most of the world is a good place but sometimes I think so may horrendous things you hear about - will it change? ||| People have been killing or hurting each other since the beginning of the time. ||| All the complicated genetics. ||| Yes it is.   My guess is will be imprisoned for a very long time.  Of course, juries are so undependable - you just never know if they will convict. ||| Me too.   People going to jail because they did something to themselves is ridiculous.  Get them help.   It's why prisons are running over with inmates ||| you too goodbye ||| They did.  He fell while working with his father harvesting vegetables.  He just couldn't get him out due to how small it is.  Then they had to calculate where to stop digging. ||| I would be terrified if I was that little.   I just can't fathom what the little guy was thinking.   Did he scream - was he badly hurt - was he cold.  It's very disturbing to me being a parent.   I have to push those thoughts away. ||| I don't know.  They were very sparse with the details.   Maybe that's the point - to see how we fill in the blanks.   I remember a similar case from Texas - they did rescue him though. ||| No - mine is gone but I do have 2 small grandchildren. ||| Agreed.   My biggest fear is they can't play outside by themselves for fear of someone driving by and taking them.   You can't let them walk or bike to a park.   Back in the day, that never crossed your mind at all.   They are both little girls so human trafficking is a nightmare to even entertain. ||| Exactly!   Played with other kids in other yards etc.   I feel they have missed an important part of being a kid. ||| I do believe the level has increased.  I also think we see it in so many mediums 24/7.  That was not the case prior to the explosive growth of technology options.   Definitely with you on how our anxiety levels are heightened when you hear about it all the time. ||| I have not - have you? ||| Oh my!   Gave me cold chills reading that statement.   So many kids choosing to end their life.  We had one last year who jumped off a local bridge because of all the bullying on social media.   Parents have to get involved for this to stop.  Just take the account down. ||| goodbye ||| I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you? ||| It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen? ||| Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating. ||| Wow you hit the nail on the head.    Was your mom paid fairly or given the opportunity to advance - gender set aside? ||| Oh I am so happy for her!    You raised two great children and now doing something she loves.  US being so low on the pay inequality is astounding.  We are \suppose\"" to be the best."" ||| Exactly and the same with education - Our society is based on me, me, me.  It ||| I apologize for hitting the return key too quickly.   My daughter ended up changing my granddaughters to Montessori.   There kids actually learn, experience, have one on one help and concentrate not only on studies but encouraging them to be great human beings.  Public schools now are full of bullies and teaching to a test. ||| It does.  My daughter was in gifted.  We called it the \little yellow schoolhouse\"" because it was a building separate from the school.   What an experience and jumpstart both of you had in pursuing goals and futures."" ||| Me too.   I am proud of this country and like to see us at least be in the top 10.    Are there other pay equality issues you want to comment on? ||| goodbye ||| It saddens me to see the US at 45th below African nations ||| It's not okay for women to not get paid equally.  Disagree ||| No they aren't ||| You didn't even read the article.  Name on sentence you read ||| I told you that with my first statement - expand ||| No - what the article actually referenced.  You can't ||| It was a full length article about other things - you can't name it - you didn't read it ||| It is for me to decide because this is the purpose of the survey - not just spouting ignorance that doesn't pertain to the gest of the article ||| no but you are in the ignorance in how you relate to the people.   All your statements are sexist, ignorant and most likely have no job.   The content of the article is not referenced by you.  Only thing you say continually is women shouldn't get to pay with ridiculous comments.   Everyone has an opinion but is yours supported by anything other than ignorant comments?  so far know. ||| goodbye ||| My first impression is what is wrong with people.   Why would you pick it up and then throw it down to the ground?   If you hurt animals, something is really off.   What about your? ||| I am a firm believer that if you do hurt animals you are either a psychopath or sociopath.    I wonder if the story was true about Pinky? ||| I wonder what was different in his mind on the second flamingo? ||| I wish they had included the video of Pinky dancing :) ||| It is.   I have no idea what the life span is of a flamingo?   Do you? ||| Even though it was a horrendous act, I do not see jailing someone.   He should have had to do a lot of community service and pay a hefty fine.  Thoughts? ||| You think?   Our prisons are overflowing. ||| Totally agree.  The Netflix show about the Central Park murder was so distressing.  Did you see it? ||| All those boys that did nothing were jailed.   The only reason they were chosen was because they were in the area and the police and DA just wanted to find someone quickly.  (: ||| It's very very sad.   I have enjoyed chatting with you.   Please have a great day.  goodbye ||| It was really sad.   Why would any human being kill a flamingo in a zoo ||| Something - the fine was way too small in my opinion ||| Busch gardens is so beautiful - he must be psychopath since he hurts animals ||| Normally it's packed - I'm sure people were videoing it but never stopped to help.   That kills me - videoing the attack but doing nothing ||| They really have.   Humanity as we use to know is slowly slipping away ||| School shootings are interpreted as \oh another shooting\"" when children are dead or severely injured"" ||| It really bothers me - people seldom help others anymore. ||| We are - the numbers of people that are homeless or living in welfare situations are now viewed if they would only try - so much more they won't accept.   Mental illness is part of homelessness and poverty is a result that our wages are not keeping up with what it just costs to live anymore. ||| Very crazy when housing has gone up from 25-50%.    No healthcare - no family to check on their state of mind.   I see many veterans that need so much. ||| I know.  Makes no sense.    It's been so nice chatting with you.    goodbye ||| To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politics ||| It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all. ||| Exactly.  I honestly wish social media was never born. ||| Agreed.   All these little 10 year olds committing suicide because of social media.   They shouldn't even be on social media.   It's so sad ||| Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs. ||| Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc. ||| Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it. ||| Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities. ||| Young people live their life online - every moment documented - it portrays a life that don't live and hurts those that are absent from their postings.   It will be interesting to see it either shift away or continue its destructive path ||| It is an addiction.   Apple, Steve Jobs, would not even give his kids a phone because he knew the damage it would cause in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain as well as its addictive qualities. ||| goodbye ||| The amount of food that the US wastes is beyond comprehension.   Your thoughts? ||| Everyone does.   I believe a \portion\"" of the problem is there is no where to take it in most communities."" ||| Exactly!   I have had parties in the past where there are trays and trays of great food that could be taken somewhere.   There isn ||| I apologize for hitting send too quickly.  :)  They do not here in Colorado.   They will take unopened boxes or cans and that's about it. ||| I just think about all the homeless shelters as well as those that are on the street.   Every community knows where they are so a drop off place should be available. ||| I go more often instead of a larger purchase.  I have found you do not throw away so much food.   I also do not believe all the expiration dates, use by this date, etc.   I have eaten it if it has never been open. ||| Exactly!   Same thing with medicine.   I have even asked the doctor about expiration dates and he said no such thing.   Big Pharma doing the same thing you noted.   I just want to do something to adjust everyone's thinking but few get on board ||| We could do so much just here in US.   I work with a great deal of at-risk children and refugee families that have been located here.    All of those folks stay hungry.   Public assistance isn't enough and the refugee families have extremely large families. ||| It is sad.   The % of American children that go to bed hungry every night makes me sad.  Yet it's never discussed ||| yes it is and ramen.   A few stores here do it only at Thanksgiving or Christmas.   Why is it limited to those? ||| And the hunger in the rest of the world is astounding.    Occasionally you will get the sad TV commercial of malnourished kids in Africa, etc. but I don't give to those.   Most of it is given to huge executive salaries (mad face) ||| Agreed.   Mark Cuban takes a big piece of Goodwill sales as if he needs more money. ||| Yes it is - March of Dimes, etc. all the same way. ||| It has been a pleasure indeed talking with you.    Have a blessed day.   goodbye ||| What a sad, sad story (: ||| By the article, there was a great deal going on their lives, regardless of the Mom's PTSD with the little girl.   The entire household would be affected.   I just do not understand how things get so dark you would someone especially your family. ||| I totally agree.   If one of them had mental illness, the other should have insisted they get help or have them committed. ||| All the parents, grandparents, friends, etc.   I cannot imagine what they all feel. ||| They did.   My daughter has a lifelong friend whose husband is very mentally ill.   Her lifelong friend will not do what is the best for him.   My daughter is a psyc major.   Her fear is he will kill of them.   They have three little boys.  It just seems like everybody has their head in the sand.   Just like this story. ||| The interesting thing about this article is Facebook told a different story.  I feel like most of Facebook just wants to project look at me, look at me. ||| Agreed.   I worry about the first generation of our kids children.   Everything is on social media.   Worst thing that we have ever technologically done. ||| Yes they do.  We had a freshman in high school jump off a bridge because of horrendous bullying.   However, I feel like parents have a huge responsibility of monitoring all social media AND no child should have those accounts until high school ||| All kinds of studies indicate that their brains cannot process what is going on because their frontal cortex is not developed.   You can't unsee what you saw. ||| I cannot think about that much.   It's very disturbing.  What were they thinking as they were being shot (: ||| Nor can I.   It has been great chatting with you today.   I hope your day is filled with joy.    goodbye ||| This article is so concerning. ||| Why do all the work to see if drinking water is safe, and then assess no fines or penalties? ||| I know!   So we are wasting millions in analyzing and then do nothing.   The entire article I was thinking we need more Erin Brockovich's in the world to hold all accountable. ||| I feel nothing is being done due to all the kickbacks and buyoffs that has to be going on. ||| Yes he is.   I think in another 20 years, clean water will be almost unattainable ||| I know.  There are several counties in Eastern KY and of course Michigan than have not had clean water for years.  Those counties in Eastern Kentucky were on TV.   They are poor and do not have the extra cash to buy water all the time.   There was a huge fundraiser that was done.  They raised enough for 2 years of water for them.   Residents were showing what their water was.   It was black sludge.   The county knew it and did nothing.   He was videoed and ran from the cameras.   Makes me very angry. ||| Obama didn't do anything for them either.   It should be at the top of every sitting President's list but it gets shoeved ||| I so agree.   EPA is run horribly.  My main concern other than the penalties/fines, etc. is what it is doing to our children.   I am extremely concerned. ||| No - what is that? ||| Ooh.   None of this is good.   I think the whole process of getting anything done anymore is there are too many levels changes go through to get anything substantial done. ||| And PACs for elections.  They are all corrupt. ||| It did.   You are very well versed in politics.  I barely watch it.  It's all opinions and few facts. ||| Every President from the beginning of time lies, lies, lies.  The only one I feel was truthful was Abraham Lincoln.   Sad to type it. ||| So true.   Well let's hope something is done before it's too late with all the water issues.   It was great interacting with you.     goodbye ||| goodbye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| Absolutely.  And not even older cities anymore.  Most states have areas where they have not had clean water for up to 5 years.   Small towns in Eastern Kentucky is an example ||| Me either.   EPA hands out violations but doesn't follow up or assign huge monetary fines is ridiculous.  Why do the work if there is no follow up to see if company fixed their issues ||| It was.    The county government in Eastern Kentucky just kept tons of money (I don't know the details - just saw it on the News) and nothing was fixed.   They have no drinking water, cooking water, or water to bathe or for toilets.  It just makes me mad. ||| Exactly.   The checks and balances have to improve before anything gets improved. ||| It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average. ||| We are the United States of America on the decline.  Pollution, drinking water, education, housing costs, 1 out of 5 people are hungry - we need to oust everyone every year in the government so it doesn't become about them personally. ||| Agreed.   Did you see the documentary on Flint on all the neglect, corruptness, etc.?   They needed an Erin Brockavich. (Spelling) ||| It's even worse that I had imagined.  I worry about all those folks ||| Me either.   It was so very nice chatting with you.  goodbye"
p011,"It is such a shame isn't it that so many people in our country don't understand how important it is to not waste food don't you think? I know that I am also to blame sometimes, and when I throw away food that's been in my fridge I often feel guilty, do you? I really try hard not to waste food though. I wish others felt the same way. ||| I was not connected to anyone after reading the article on Aleppo and the horrible circumstances that the elderly face after the destruction wrought on the city. I was told by the System to enter the code after the survey so I completed the survey and answered with all neutral answers. The instructions said that I would get paid if I somehow was not connected with anyone (i.e. if they disconnected). I guess in this situation they did in fact disconnect. I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so. War tears cities apart, and it is hard for me to understand how so many innocent people suffer due to the whims of those in power. I hope to get paid for my efforts. Good luck.","I thought the article detailed the atrocities in Aleppo quite well. ||| It is a shame that the innocent have to suffer in war. ||| Do you have any friends from Syria? ||| Yes, I have one good friend from college from there. ||| He lives in the United States, but he has family and friends that live in Syria. ||| I feel quite badly for him. He is actually pro-Assad and so are his family members. ||| He says that we get an extremely biased viewpoint, and that the war is over a natural gas pipeline with competing interests (The U.S. versus Russia). ||| He has actually thinking about moving back there to be with his family which is hard for me to understand with all of the chaos going on over there. ||| I know. He has very strong emotions, of course, and when I see how emotional he gets it really bothers me too. ||| I agree. I hope that some peace can come there soon. It is just so hard to see so much violence going on around the world in places like Syria. ||| I really think in lots of ways we want the same things for ourselves and our families we just fight over things that really should not be fought over in my opinion. I think that you might need to do something according to the instructions. ||| I think we've had a good conversation don't you? It's been great chatting with you. Bye! ||| bye bye ||| Hi there, how are you today? ||| I think it's really sad. People just don't try very hard to not waste food. Don't you think? ||| I know that I'm guilty sometimes of wasting food. How about you? ||| Do you ever shop at CostCo or BJ's? ||| I love Aldi's. Lidl too. We just got a few around where I live. ||| I sometimes buy too much food at CostCo because it's \such a great deal\"". Then I throw away much more than I want to."" ||| I can't believe some of the statistics from that article though. It's shocking that so many people don't think it's a problem. ||| Really? I haven't seen any yet. That would be great if it does.  There's a company, I forget the name but a friend of mine gets her food from them, that sells food that is slightly out of date but is still highly edible. ||| Maybe that's the same one. I need to talk to her about it. ||| Do you use it? ||| I hope that reading this article will get me to buy less produce at CostCo even when it's on sale. ||| If I had a bigger freezer I would do that. I might just try and get two fruits at a time. ||| I could always just go to a local supermarket if I really wanted a fruit and not waste so much, you know? ||| I didn't know that there were YouTubers that talked about this a lot. Do you watch many food channels? ||| One last thing. Do you think the article will make you talk about this with others more? ||| Me too. Great chat. bye"
p012,"I find this inexcusable, and hope the officer is charged with the death of a police officer (as the K9 unit is considered one). This is really awful, and I'm sure the officer in question feels bad, but we need to make examples out of this case. If we set a precedent, making the punishment fit the crime perfectly, it will deter carelessness.  ||| It's terrible to hear about what people have to go through in Haiti after a crisis like hurricane Matthew. I take for granted what it's like to live in an area where I and my family do not have to worry about these situations. I hope everyone receives the help they need in Haiti, as I'm sure they need all of the assistance they can get.","It's definitely really sad to read, considering everything they're all going through. What did you think? ||| I can't imagine just living in an area that is constantly being ravaged by hurricanes or earthquakes. I take my location for granted. ||| It also seems unnecessary for there to even be such a gap. With all of the wealthy countries out there, I hope Haiti gets the help it deserves, because we, and other countries, can certainly afford it. ||| It's disheartening, isn't it? Places have the ability, money, time, and knowledge, and still refuse to help. ||| Yep, exactly. It's just very frustrating overall. I think it's hard for others because they don't understand until their houses are being swept away for torrential floods. ||| Give it twenty more years, for the more compassionate people to come into leadership. I think we'll see a big difference. ||| I know it sounds cold, but the older generation either doesn't care, or doesn't want to understand. Trust me, we'll see some major change soon enough. ||| Well, it was really great talking to you. I can't think of anything else to say about the topic. goodbye ||| I apologize, I thought we did! I'm obviously a winner at counting. Hurricane Matthew was two years ago, wasn't it? ||| I think I recall it spawning a second hurricane, too, but it calmed down before being too bad. Yeah, I was definitely a few lines off lol ||| take care! goodbye ||| I found the article to be very sad, and anger-inducing. How about you? ||| Honestly, I feel like the officer should be charged with involuntary manslaughter. They consider police dogs to be police officers. I feel it's important to set a precedent here. ||| They were definitely vague. I think they were on suspended leave, un-paid. But you know, that's pretty messed up if they're not being charged with anything. I feel like negligence like that needs to be severely cracked down on. ||| It's unfortunate, but you're right. That's why I feel like they should be charged with the murder of a police officer. If a criminal were to shoot a police dog, they would be charged with murdering an officer. But a cop gets away with leaving the dog in the cop car? I mean, ugh. That's really aggravating. ||| I hope they're charged with involuntary manslaughter of a police officer. I swear, if you set a harsh punishment, you'll deter people, and make them think twice. Same goes for anyone leaving anything/anyone in a car. ||| You would think that there shouldn't be much evidence to provide. I don't think it would go that far, unfortunately, but I feel like it should. If it were a legit  human, I wonder what would happen from there. ||| There should be. I just hate hearing stories about deaths caused by cars due to negligence. I would love to see that cop do ten years for the death of that police dog. Sorry, this story gets me steamed. ||| I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with. ||| Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue. ||| I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end. But yeah, hopefully we can deter behavior like that in the end. ||| Right. I think if you set down strict rules about procedures with partners/K9 units, then, hopefully, people will pay more attention. Maybe up the punishment for this situation, and they'll definitely be more careful. ||| Yeah, hopefully all of that is already in place. If not, then it should be. Well, I can't think of anything else. My rant steamed out ha ha ||| goodbye"
p013,"I just read an article about veterans and PTSD. It was really sad to learn about how many people suffer from PTSD. The article talked about how many veterans are affraid to seek help. It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it. I can only begin to imagine what our veterans are going thrugh. We owe it to the veterans to help them ||| I just read a news article about a plane crash that killed China's forst woman to fly a J-1o fighter. That sounds like a horrible way to die. I am scared of planes for that very reason. There is nothing you can do about it. She was the very first of four woment to fly the J-10 fighter jet. The J-10 is a single engine fighter jet. She was very proud of herself for being the first woman to fly in the fighter jet. ||| I just read an article about a boy falling out of an apartment window and dying. That is so sad he was only 2 years old. The little boy pushed open the screen in his bedroom and fell out of the window to his death. We should all make sure our windows are secure and our kids cannot open them .Omg that poor boy was proably hurting so bad before he died. I cannot imagine what the parents are going through after losing a child in such a manner.","Yeah, do you know anyone with PTSD? ||| Thats terrible. I hear most of them suffer in silence ||| Have you ever had a panic attack? That's one of the things they go through according to the article. ||| what do you think can be done to prevent PTSD ||| i agree with that ||| yeah some of them even get deported ||| nope some of them are legal. got deported after fighting for our country ||| because they did something small like J walking or anything considered illegal. Even a ||| hope they research this PTSD and find solutions ||| should happen in the future ||| wonder how a cyborg brain would work ||| bye ||| I think the accident is horrible, could you imagine dying like that? ||| I will not get on a plane, I couldnt imagine being killed in the air ||| lol nope, I'll drive anywhere I need to go ||| Do you think she was in some way sabotaged? ||| I like how she was so proud of herself for being the first woman to pilot the fighter jet ||| She got to make her dream come true and she died doing what she loved so that is a plus but I never like to hear about a death ||| Yeah I agree there is many unanswered questions ||| yes for sure, do you believe that it is a true story? do you think we could find additional coverage on the story? Do you remember her name? ||| Ok, I love watching documentaries, I like true television not so much a fan of fiction ||| I am supposed to be in one about Mturk and the gig economy later on this year and it will be on Netflix...I'm excited ||| Yes I was contacted by some woman named Shannon Walsh...I didnt believe it at first but I did some research and it is legit...she is a film maker from canada...I talked with her on the phone and they are going to be here in Florida either next month or september. I really enjoyed chatting with you goodbye ||| I think that is horrible can you imagine what the parents are going through after this ||| Yes it is terrible, it made me think about some of the windows in my house ||| I have a couple windows up stairs that I need to look at, I dont think my son can reach them but you kids can be very creative when they want something ||| That poor baby was probably in so much pain before dying ||| It probably happens more than we hear about it ||| Certainly do, it is best to prevent accidents from happening ahead of time by identifying threats ||| I think that parents should make sure that all windows are locked securely ||| Yes deffinately, I'm sure the parent is pretty upset with themself right now ||| They sell cheap window locks that can put on any window on Amazon ||| I'm pretty sure they can be applied to any window, I recently bought some to go on the cabinets in the kitchen ||| It really does make you question what they parents where doing when this happened ||| I know children can be sneaky but I would imagine you can hear your kid trying to climb out of a window ||| Exactly, so some of the blame deffinately is on the parent ||| How should a problem like that be addressed? Should it be on the news to notify all parents of the dangers? ||| Yes that's what I was saying but I doubt parents would watch a boring show about kids falling from windows ||| Yes I enjoyed speaking with you goodbye"
p014,"I really feel for the people who depend on that river for their livilihood. it seems like real lasting and permanent damage has been caused, and people don't really know what to do about it or do next. The confusion that remains is awful. It sounds like a lot of people's fishing careers will never before restored with the river the way it is now. ||| This would be a horrifying experience to go through. I can't imagine how a father could handle that experience, especially the way that he learned about his daughter's tragedy. That would be just entirely too much to go through. How can can that even be processed? its just all seems so surreal, like something you would read about, but not actually go through.","hello, that was really tough to read, hearing about how many people are financially impacted by that mud flood ||| its beyond a year later, and it doesn't seem like any normalcy has returned ||| if at all.

p015,The article in itself is extremely depressing. Animals starving due to a Country also starving. There's nothing that can be done for these animals as they're just in an unfortunate circumstance. It's astonishing that this is allowed to happen in general though. They are helpless creatures starving to death because nobody is helping them. There should be charities that make this impossible to happen.,
p016,"That's so sad about the situation with the coal and all the wildlife it's misplacing. It was kind of crazy reading the story about having the elephant crash into those people's houses -- i can't imagine having a giant two ton creature come through my wall! I'm glad no one was hurt, but it still sounds pretty scary. ||| Honestly the entire story is just so sad and really highlights how devastating the effects of greed are. It's not enough that our policies and hunger for power wreck human lives, we have to wreck entire environments and species, too. I feel so bad for the animals, and it just goes to show how much worse things must be for the actual humans. ||| I just read about this family that got killed in a car wreck and it was just horrible. It's one thing when part of your family dies, but apparently the husband had already died a few months previous and now the mom and two of the kids are dead, too, and that just leaves one kid who I guess was about five or six. She's all alone now. :( ||| Ugh, this story is so depressing. Cave ins and things like this are always devastating, but even more so when you dig and dig and find nothing. It reminds me of the dogs in 9/11 who got depressed over not finding survivors, or the Mexico earthquake where they made up a survivor just to make people feel better. It's so, so sad. :( ||| I can't understand why someone would want to attack an animal like that that wasn't harming anyone and was just minding its own business. Like, how insensitive do you have to be to just kill something for fun? I was also surprised the flamingo was sol old; I had no idea they could live to be nineteen. ||| This is why it's so important to always get things on tap, because if it hadn't been I guarantee the officers would have tried to have said that they didn't do anything and it was all just her resisting arrest. I don't understand why they didn't just look the warrant up to see if it was still active instead of harassing her like that. ||| lol, yeah, definitely an accidental death when the guy shows up with blows all over his body, makes perfect sense. I'm not surprised, though ‚Äî anything involving Russia is going to have some kind of cover up at play. It's hard to say who did it, though ‚Äî his own government or someone outside of it. It's a messed up situation. ||| I get so frustrated when I read articles like this, because I know so many people who just plug their ears and act like nothing is happening and everything is fine, when it's clearly not. We're destroying entire species if not the planet with our willful ignorance if not straight out denial, and I'm afraid it's going to be too late to do anything. ||| I can't imagine losing a pet like that. It's one thing when it's to an accident or disease or something, but to know they died in a fire and you couldn't get them out... I'd feel so guilty. Plus you'd have lost your home and all your possessions, and your best little friend is gone now too. I'm so glad I've never lost a pet. ||| I am fully in support of this movement, and am glad it's finally getting some traction. I know that even just a few years ago, women finally got the right to drive in Saudi Arabia (before that, only men could). Liberating anyone is good for everyone, and women in Saudi Arabia have had their rights denied from them for far too long. ||| I think it's pretty sad that the wolf got killed. I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper. ||| I can't imagine being a fourteen year old kid and losing my eyesight; that's just so sad. I don't think it's right to fire at people who can't defend themselves, and the fact that it sounds like they're using pellet guns with new shapes just to cause more damage is awful. I hope that girl gets more help in the future. ||| It's amazing how statistics can show you how bad things are, but it's individual stories that really make you feel them. Like, reading about how 4,000 civilians have been killed in the crossfire? that's sad. But somehow reading about just one man, who ran an taxi service or a guy with an ice cream truck and leaving behind eight kids? Devastating. ||| I've never been in a fire personally or really known about one, but I can't imagine how terrifying that would be. I kind of wonder how the people outside of the complex got hurt - I wonder if they were trying to get people out, or if some of the fire/debri came outside? Either way, it would be terrifying. I'm glad no one died. ||| I can't imagine losing a kid this way. 'Cause like... he'd be literally right there, you know? You could hear him if he said anything, maybe even see him if the whole was straight enough. But there'd be no way to get to him. Just forty feet away and your kid is dying. Ugh. I feel so bad for his dad, I hope he doesn't blame himself. ||| I've heard a lot of about the opioid crisis, but it's usually been in regards to older people being prescribed poorly and getting addicted, so this came as a bit of a shock. It's so sad to think of a little kid getting ahold of something and having no idea what it is, and then they're just... gone. I feel so bad for their families. ||| It's crazy how many creatures are dying from the river drying up, but it just goes to show you how important water is. I think we often take water for granted in the US (or at least, in parts of the US), so we don't think about how precious it is. It's insane that that one species was almost entirely gone because of it. ||| I hate senseless violence like this so much, when the people that are dying aren't even the ones involved in the conflicts and are just minding their own business. Like, these are people just walking home or making bread or getting water for their families and then they're just... gone. It isn't fair.","What did you think? ||| Yeah. I wish we had better options than coal. It seems like it's wrecking environments everywhere these days. ||| For sure. I can't imagine having an elephant burst through my house! ||| Probably wouldn't even pay for a single night's stay in a hospital. ||| Yeah. It's bad enough when things like this affect people actually involved, but when you have people getting hurt that weren't even part of it it's just so much worse. ||| I wouldn't be surprised; many animals have similar lung structures as humans do. It's probably why the elephants etc. have been in so many altercations lately. ||| Oh for sure. Many of the appalachian areas, for example, still have serious environmental damages and generational health issues. ||| Yeah. Economics & tradition -- many families have been in the business for so long they can't imagine doing anything else. It's their way of life almost more than it is a living. ||| True true. Do you think we should be investing in finding cleaner forms of energy? ||| We're in agreement then. Something needs to be done soon before we run out of options & time. ||| Same. Do you have any further thoughts? ||| bye! ||| Wow. What did you think of the article? ||| I found it super upsetting. :( Kinda feels like power + greed wrecks everything -- people, environments, animals. :( ||| Feeding lions pumpkins or whatever caught my eye the most. Like, they're carnivores, that won't keep them alive. What do you think should be done? ||| I don't know. Zoos are already kinda questionable ethically, but I for sure think you shouldn't have one if you can't take care of it. It seems like the animals should be moved elsewhere. ||| I assume they'd have to be moved somewhere else, maybe another country's zoo or wildlife center until they can be put somewhere permanently? ||| It'd have to be another organization, I think the article mentioned a couple -- IFAW and Four Paws or something? But getting the governments to agree would be tricky. ||| Yeah. It's sad how it seems to be going on in a lot of countries. :( ||| And then if the animals are getting that bad of a hand, the actual people are, too. :( ||| The fact that we still have famine/hunger issues when there's more than enough food to go around is a true failure of our time ||| Yeah. Do you have any further thoughts? ||| i don't think so. bye! ||| Really sad and really frustrating. :( I wish we were doing more to stop it. ||| Yeah. Both of my parents and most the my family actually denies it's happening. Thanksgiving's going to be real fun this year. ||| Just say it's natural/the earth \always does this.\"" It's mind blowing."" ||| Unfortunately. :( And it's so frustrating bc it means we're blocked from getting things done to change it. ||| Indeed. Have you been following the movement around Greta Thornburg? ||| She definitely feels very strongly about it. It's just a little mindboggling to me that one of the most well known voices is 16. ||| Yeah, there's a lot of movement and political awareness it seems like. ||| I do most of the basic stuff--try to get local food, avoid waste, cut down on gas/electrics as much as possible. Cutting down on gas is hard though since I live in a smaller town w no public transportation. ||| It definitely can feel that way, especially considering how much pollution the big companies are pumping out. ||| bye! ||| It was so sad. :( I can't imagine losing a pet like that. ||| Yeah. Like, not only did you lose your house, you lost your two best little buds. That's awful. ||| It sounded like they got out without issue, so that's good. ||| I dunno. I feel really bad for the little kids. :( ||| For sure. I hope they get new pets soon. ||| Mmhm, and family photos, drawings... so many memories. I can't imagine that. ||| Yeah, by a curling iron once when I was little decently badly. Not fun at all. ||| Yikes! On purpose or by accident? ||| Yeah, kids be crazy like that. Have you known anyone who lost their home like in the story? Or a pet? ||| You too. bye! ||| I think it's about time and I'm very glad the movement has so much traction! ||| Indeed. I know women just got the right to drive in Saudi Arabia a short while ago, so things are looking up at least. ||| Yep. Only men could get licenses before that (one of the many ways to keep women from being independent). ||| Agreed! It's baffling to me that there's an opposition protest to the movement. Just... Yikes™. ||| Yeah, that's unfortunately how things often go. Like, even in the US, it took until 1990 for opinion polls to get over 50% of people approving of biracial marriages. Prejudice takes so long to die off :/ ||| Yeah. We like to pretend all that's in the past, but it's way closer than we think. ||| Whoa, that's nuts. Yikes for sure. ||| Yeah. I hope the situation in Saudi Arabia continues to change, hopefully without violence. ||| Honestly, I feel like we (the US) are too invested in their oil production to let that level of disruption happen. ||| Yeah. For good or ill. *shrug* ||| Agreed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article? ||| bye! ||| How'd it make you feel? :( ||| Just. So angry, honestly. What a terrible way to die. ||| I just—jeez. I wish he hadn't have been able to get a gun if he was that unstable. ||| I mean, I don't remember where he lived, but in a lot of places in the US it's just normal to have one ||| Oh, gotcha. I feel like that happens sometimes, especially when it's the dad that's suicidal. ||| Yeah, I can't even imagine coming home to that. :( ||| I feel like that starts to stray too far into eugenics. People will mental illness are more likely to experience violence than enact it, after all. ||| Haha, I've had them, so yes. Not in the past five years though. :) ||| Therapy's great! I recommend it to anyone, honestly. ||| Yeah, but it's a friend who super knows what they're talking about, and sometimes a perspective with a bit of distance can be really helpful. ||| bye! ||| Yeah. I can't believe it was killed by an actual sniper; that's nuts. ||| I don't know; it sounded like it was kind of their job, so probably it'd just be the organization. ||| Especially since it seemed like the wolf wasn't hurting anybody! ||| Yeah. It's kind of funny; I was just listening to a podcast yesterday about how we actually need more wolves in the US bc we messed up the ecosystem. ||| I honestly don't get it, myself. I mean, I understand if you need food or something, but just doing it for fun... ||| The stuffed ones they hang on the walls are the ones I really don't like. It just seems... blegh. ||| It's biting us, though. Bc of the lower wolf population there's a ton of deer, which means more ticks, which has resulted in a massive spike in lyme disease over the past 20 years. All because we killed the wolves. ||| I bet there's some kind of petition or bill people could lobby for. Like through a wildlife conservation? ||| Yeah. Like I said, if you gotta hunt to eat, fine. But death shouldn't be a sport. ||| It was nice talking to you too! It's funny, I was thinking about the 700 miles thing. It sounds like so much, but humans travel about 70,000 miles in their lifetime. Poor wolf. :( ||| bye! ||| Reading about any car wreck is hard, but when there's kids involved... yikes. ||| Especially since it sounds like they already lost their dad, just... holy cow. ||| Yeah, for sure. I don't think it said her age but if she was the middle child between 8 and 2 she can't be more than like, 6. ||| I can't imagine living with that. They must feel just awful. ||| Agreed. I wonder how the rest of the people in the wreck are handling it — the article said it was like 10 people in the trailer, right? ||| I think everyone will need therapy, honestly. That line about the shoes by the side of the road with candy and blood... ouch. ||| Yeah, there's no way he wasn't speeding. Not a good move, especially on Halloween when you know there's going to be kids around. ||| Yeah, I grew up in a small town and visibility was always bad. My dad told me to always wait three seconds after a light turned green at night just in case. ||| For sure. They always act like they own the road >.> ||| Definitely. Not worth it, as evidenced. But anyway, it was nice talking to you, even if the topic was depressing. ||| bye! ||| It was so sad; I can't imagine being 14 and going blind :( ||| Especially since the article said they've started using specially designed pellets to make the damage worse! ||| Hard to say it's \just crowd control\"" or whatever when it says they're designed to cause maximum dispersal w damage."" ||| Yeah. And humans are not animals. :/ ||| More likely they care more about political power and land. Splitting Pakistan and India has been problematic since it first happened :/ ||| Yes, Pakistan was once part of India and it was split apart in 1947. The concept was to split apart the regions based on religious beliefs but families got split across the border and it has never quite gotten over it. ||| Or the attempt in Vietnam, yes. ||| Anyway, going back to the article, I thought it was really sad that the girl seemed to have been blinded for no reason — it sounded like she just got caught in the crossfire or something. ||| I wonder if there's any hope of her fulfilling that dream now that she's blind :( ||| Senseless violence usually is :( ||| We are indeed a species with a large capacity both for senseless violence and reckless kindness. ||| bye! ||| What did you think of the article? I found myself distracted trying to figure out when it happened (like, what year). ||| It's never a good sign when reporters are fired/attacked/maligned for doing their jobs, yeah. ||| Agreed. It was startling how many people the article said were stateless, too—nearly a million, I think it said? ||| I can't imagine how difficult that would be to manage, plus with the health services being suspended. That's a recipe for disaster :/ ||| Especially in the camps the article mentioned; the article said there aren't any doctors at most of clinics. ||| I think it mentioned something about the US investigating and the UN having numbers on the people in a food crisis, but nothing concrete about them actually helping, which is unfortunate. ||| Agreed. Unfortunately, politics and grudges often take precedence over aid. :/ ||| It sounded like Myanmar's government will have to start not denying there's a problem. ||| There's always money involved and it's rarely a good thing. It's too bad their democracy bid didn't work out. ||| Last I heard, there's a major genocide threat in Myanmar so it doesn't seem like things will be looking up soon, no. :( ||| bye! ||| Other than more death, unfortunately. ||| I mean, we managed to ban certain gases after WWI, so I don't think it's completely impossible, but it seems more likely that we might get more distinct rules about when you can use them. ||| The story about the taxi cab driver was gutting. :( ||| I mean I don't think I'm necessarily qualified/informed enough to make that call. But I do think we get involved far too often because we want something, not because we just want to help. ||| It seems like it's all posturing and looking imposing without actually /doing/ something most of the time. But then, if they did have power, we'd probably complain about that. ||| You mean like a WWIII kind of deal? I think probably no, if only because weapons are so advanced at this point most countries know if we did, it'd be... all kinds of catastrophic. You? ||| That's true. The situation in Saudi Arabia right now with the attack on the oil producers (idk the technical term) has a lot of people antsy. ||| True, though there are some promising alternatives that could get funded. ||| Which is hard, because many of the oil companies deliberately drop prices when alternatives are being considered for funding to make people less inclined. ||| That's certainly hard to say. We messed a lot of things up when we decided to divide the countries after WWII. ||| Mm, possibly. Ideological differences make big waves, too. ||| lol, yeah I don't think that tends to go over well. ||| I think that about covers it. It was nice talking to you! ||| bye! ||| It's really sad, but I'm so glad no one was killed! ||| Yeah. I feel like as soon as I hear any bad news these days I immediately brace for the worst. ||| Oh, I guess it didn't say, did it? That's odd. I feel like a gas leak is usually the suspect. ||| Haha, probably depends on what they can afford, honestly. If only eight people were inside it must have been small. ||| Yeah. I feel like it would also depend on how bad my injuries were — like, are we talking smoke inhalation or 3rd degree burns? ||| I wonder how the people outside the apartment got hurt. There was an explosion, right? I wouldn't want to get caught in that. ||| Yeah, I think only one person had to go to the hospital, so the explosion must have happened in an area a decent distance from the inhabitants. ||| Yeah. I wonder if they had to find somewhere else to live, at least while the investigation's underway? ||| It'd definitely be the respectable thing to do. I wonder if any of the building was salvageable. ||| Ooooh, yeah, that would be awful! Especially if you'd lived there a long time and had lots of memories and stuff. :( ||| Eeeep. My worst nightmare :/ ||| Yeah. :( Well, I think that's about everything... did anything else in the article strike you? ||| Sure, that's fine! I know most people have to have rental insurance; does that cover fire damage? ||| That's good, hopefully everyone involved will have that. I wonder if the people just on the street will get anything for health insurance. ||| Eep, that's not a good idea. Renter's insurance is super cheap comparatively and can save you a lot of heartache. I had a pipe on the washing machine break one time and it flooded the whole floor. No insurance would've been a nightmare. ||| Yep, I'm good. :) It was great talking with you! ||| bye! ||| Ugh. This was really hard to read :( ||| From what I understand, a lot of times these things happen because companies are just cutting to many corners involving safety and maintenance. :/ ||| Natural disasters are always hard, but there's something about hearing that rescuers worked for so long and then just found they were already dead. It's an extra level of heart break. ||| I guess knowing for sure is better than just living in that question, but still... ouch. :( ||| Yeah. This article kinda reminds me of the aftermath of 9/11, when they had rescue dogs looking for people and they couldn’t find anyone, and the dogs got so depressed rescuers started pretending to be lost just so the dogs would have someone to find. :( ||| Yeah. And then there was this other situation in Mexico where there was an earthquake and it took out a school, and there were no survivors so officials just made up a story about a 12 year old girl being alive to boost morale. :/ ||| Yeah. Sometimes having hope is more important than there actually being one. ||| Yeah. If you ever want to get simultaneously frustrated, heartbroken, and understanding, the fake girl's name was \Frida Sofia\"" and there's plenty of articles on it. But. Anyway."" ||| Indeed. Going back to the situation in China, it's kind of alarming that there are over 1,000 mining operations that they can shut down for being outdated. ||| Yeah. No wonder they're the most dangerous country for mining accidents. ||| Things almost always go poorly when you care more about profit than about people. ||| For sure. ||| bye! ||| I hate that he got away with hurting so many women before he was caught :( ||| Agreed. I hope he gets a better sentence than that athlete from awhile back >.> ||| It's ridiculous. Like, they have clear evidence that they did it so it's not like it's up for debate, and then they get like three months or something. ||| Yeah. What did you think of his lawyer's plea at the end of the article? About \politically correct culture\"" swaying opinion of the case?"" ||| 100% agree with you. Everyone's against him because he's been caught, not because of some agenda. ||| Yeah. The only disturbing thing about him being \only a student/only 20\"" or whatever is that he's already managed to assault FIVE women. Bro clearly has no intention of shaping up."" ||| Mmmmmhm. The statistics on assault are horrifying; especially on campuses. Do you have any opinions on what should be done about it? ||| Awareness, better accountability. There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea. ||| Yeah. I think dry campuses are the way to go. Like, if you want to live off campus and drink no one can stop you, but the level of blackout drinking at like frat parties or whatever is a bad idea. ||| Yeah. Your brain's not even fully developed until 25 and when you're chugging 7, 8, 9 beers at 18... Yipes. ||| bye! ||| Ugh, I can't even imagine. To know your kid is just forty feet away and you... you can't get to him. ||| I mean, what are the odds? It was only a foot wide; the kid had to have fallen just so to even fit. ||| Yeah, for sure. I hope the kid died on impact. Waiting in the dark, injured, would be awful. :( ||| Ugh, nope, no. On the one hand at least then the kid could hear his dad's voice, but on the other... nope. ||| It's humbling how we can do so much and yet be thwarted by just a too-small hole. ||| Life is precious. I wonder what will happen to the well now, since i guess it's torn up. ||| Yeah. Or even in the US standards are a little different if you're in a rural area. ||| Opposite here -- born and raised country, moved towards the city. Good and bad things to both. ||| Yeah. It sounds like it was a freak accident, and if they dug all around it, I don't know if it's even usable. For that matter, what would you need a well with a hole that small to start with? ||| Yeah, and it just kinda got grown over. I guess it was in the middle of their farm though, if they were getting vegetables? ||| Indeed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article? ||| bye! ||| I thought it was sad. :( I've heard plenty about the opioid crisis, but not in relation to kids before. ||| Yeah, though it's hard to fault them. Children are naturally curious and it only takes you forgetting one time to lead to disaster. ||| It's especially sad because they would have had no concept that what they're doing would be a problem. They probably just thought it was candy or something. ||| Yeah. It mentioned that the kids are figuring out how to open the bottles — maybe better child proofing should be looked in to? ||| Not personally, no, but I used to nanny for several different families so I'm well aware of the trouble they can get themselves into, haha. You? ||| Yeah. :( All it takes is a split second of inattention — and no one can pay attention /all/ the time — and bam. :( ||| Indeed. Going back to the problem, I also think it would help if opioids just weren't prescribed as much as they are. Kids can't get ahold of them if the parents don't have them, after all. ||| Yeah. The statistics in America for opioid overdose are horrible and they've been climbing every year. From what I understand the biggest issue is in doctors just over prescribing and then people get addicted largely by accident. ||| It's hard to say. I expect the solution is less writing it off entirely and just being more judicious when they're handed out. Like how antibiotics are prescribed too liberally and we're creating monster viruses that are immune. ||| bye! ||| What did you think of the article? ||| It just seems so senseless; I can't imagine why someone would do it. ||| I honestly don't have much of a frame of reference, but $2K for an animal's life seems fair. ||| Yeah, agreed. And some kind of training/learning about animals. ||| I was surprised that the flamingo was 19. I wonder how old they can be? ||| Yeah. Poor guy. :( I wonder what the rest of his flock is like. ||| I know elephants mourn their dead for a long time. I wonder if flamingos are the same. :( ||| Yeah, no kidding. It said he was with his family — I'd be worried for their safety, honestly. He's clearly capable of random acts of violence. ||| Yeah. It's creepy that he'd already picked up a different flamingo. I wonder what was going through his head?? ||| Hard to say. I know that most people with mental illnesses are more likely to be abused than cause abuse, so idk if I'd want to stereotype, but. Yipes. ||| Yeah. Just sad all around, I guess. :( ||| Well, if we've covered everything, it was nice talking to you. :) bye! ||| Yeah. I think we tend to forget how important water is in the US (or at least some parts), but wow. ||| Yeah. I was stunned when it said 80% of the capybaras had died. That's insane. ||| Probably not overall, but certainly that segment is. And the one that was like 98% gone, I forget the species, but yikes. ||| Yeah. It sounds like the governments didn't handle it well at all. ||| I mean, the article made it seems like the two governments took responsibility for it, so. It seems like the way water was divided between Paraguay and Argentina was partially responsible for the discrepancy. ||| True. And with the replenishing season not coming until January, that's a long wait. ||| The question would be relocate where? If you move populations like that you run the risk of messing up the ecological balance of the new place. ||| Do zoos usually have fish populations? idk. Maybe a wildlife reservation could take on some of the land animals, but I'm not familiar with best practices for moving fish. ||| Ah okay, yeah a fish hatchery would work. But then they might get eaten and that's slightly self defeating haha. :P It's so sad to think of all the animals getting caught in the mud and sediment. :( I can't imagine the fall out from a 520 or whatever empty river. ||| :( :( It's an awful way to go. Natural disasters are hard to wrap your mind around because it reminds you of how much we just can't fix. ||| bye! ||| Airstrikes on civilians are always the worst. :( ||| Yeah. 300 people in just a handful of days... that's awful. ||| If I recall correctly it was rebels vs the syrian government, but I could be wrong. ||| I think it was Shiite Muslims who disagreed with the way Syria was being run (Syria is mostly Sunni Muslims). The Syrian government is not known for its care of people. ||| Agreed. Especially when there's kids involved. ||| Yeah. There was a really good documentary about the child refugees coming out of Aleppo a while ago. Heartbreaking. :( ||| Yeah. :( I can't even imagine... you're just minding your own business and then bam. Your house is gone. ||| For sure. We have our problems, but airstrikes aren't one of them. :/ ||| Indeed. I think that about covers it — did you have more to add? ||| goodbye <3 ||| I just hate it so much when civilians, who had nothing to do with the conflict and were minding their own business, get targeted like this :( ||| Like, I can't imagine finding out my mom was literally just in the house doing chores or whatever and then... gone. ||| Yeah. The fact that it was during what was supposed to be a cease fire is even worse. ||| I think they just said thirteen civilians, didn't mention age. But when kids are involved they usually say so, I think. ||| Oh no that's awful. :( ||| Hard to do that, unfortunately, when like in this case neither side seems willing to budge even a bit. ||| Yeah. Tensions between Pakistan and India have been tense since they were split in the 40s and it feels like nothing's really changed. ||| Just hope and work to get people out and into better situations, I guess. ||| Yep. I have zero qualms about it, actually. ||| You too! bye <3 ||| Wow. So what did you think? ||| Agreed. I'm so glad we're getting more footage of arrests these days. ||| Yeah. It's just galling about how much they'll lie about and cover up, even when it's so blatant. ||| Mmhm. It boggles my mind that police don't have to do more training about what is and isn't legal. Like, they only have one intro class on law. ||| For real?? ||| It's a messed up system from every angle. ||| Oh yeah. The fact that for-profit prisons exist is just a monumentally terrible idea. ||| that and when you're working near 24/7 just to keep your family above water, it's hard to focus on anything else. ||| Anything that keeps money lining the pockets of the wealthy. ||| Yeah. Work on so many of the little things they become big things, as it were. ||| bye! ||| So what do you think. Accident or foul play? ||| Haha, mine was the opposite, but maybe I'm just jade. ||| True. I just hear ex-aide to Putin and immediately assume something's up. ||| Ah, gotcha. Yeah no, this was one of Putin's aides and he apparently did a lot of propoganda work for them. ||| Yeah. I mean, it said he had blows to the head, neck, torso, etc. that resulted in death -- and he just died alone in his hotel room without calling for help? Seems weird. ||| Very strange, honestly. ||| Or it didn't happen in the room and he was deposited there after. ||| Or he knew too much about something, yeah. ||| Yeah, I guess that's the case no matter how it happened. He wasn't even 60, iirc. :( ||| I wonder if he had any family. :( ||| Yeah. Do you have any further thoughts on the article? ||| Okay. It was good talking to you then. bye!"
p017,"dude, you smoke, i smoke. i just switched to vaping, but you still smoke. you know you can get lung cancer? lung cancer is no joke, thousands die from it every year. you can get it from cigarettes. you can also get it from air pollution.what kinds of air pollution? first hand smoke, second hand smoke, i just found about something called radon that is a naturally occurring gas that comes from rocks and dirt, dude rocks are killing us. thats trippy.  no what do air pollution and lung cancer have to do in common? you are more suceptable to die form air pollution if you got lung cancer from those cigarettes you been smoking. either way though, the pollution can kill you though, just more easily if you got cancer. ||| life is precious. dont waste your time not doing the things you want or it might all be taken from you vefore you get a chance to do everything in this life that you want to. I just read about how a bunch of people died in paris in 2015 and it was horrible to hear about how those people died. it got me to thinking, i want to paint a self portrait. what do you want to do?",
p018,"I view the content that is sent to me online as my virtualized personalized email inbox. I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate their works cited to the various other work they are completing in ways to document not only their feelings on the article, but also progress on their goals as a person regarding their personalized information they receive. However, we as mTurk workers are afforded the luxury, and in fact the article more relates to the fact that remote workers are sometimes shut off from communication to the outside world by regular means. This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply. When I contact my superiors that also work remotely, most projects are mishandled in ways and my personalized communication style.","I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate articles in their personalizd inboxes in ways that relate to them through working means, and however as mTurk workers working remotely sometimes our means to relate are removed, and this relates to this message I received from this article. ||| I mean that if I were ordering through a produce app on my smart phone, because I work remotely online as a contractor, my personlized internet of things will probably make it so that I don't even know the farmer or where the goods come from or whatever. ||| Like there are ladders in place in society that keep everything in check, and somehow by working more incorporated (in my opinion) we have lost the ladder? Did they spill into the water supply in cohort with the protest? These are things that can make sense in order to bring a light to us stuck on the edge, but I don't see the relation and what it means to us. ||| If you don't bring anything from the article like that into the light then what. ||| Like that makes sense if this is supposed to be a how to discussion guide on how to relate to workers anywhere, but then what about the ladder they removed that allowed them to spill. ||| I don't really get it at all. I'm completely lost on your point and the article and mine now. ||| There's violence in the world and there's things happening!

What are you trying to say? ||| I'm trying to say that I'm confused that we are supposed to talk about the article, and you seem to say don't talk about it. Am I reading that right?

p019,"How sad is it that this kind of pain and suffering, and those kind of living conditions still exsist today? what a gap we have in society between developed countries and those that aren't. It's crazy to drive around the US and see all the money people spend on pointless things, and then to think about how the people in Haiti are living.  ||| I think that these kinds of stories, are sad, yet inspirational and leave you with kind of a good feeling. Even though his story is sad, it's cool and inspiring/motivational to see that he rose up against his circumstances. That he worked hard to make something of himself and he succeeded in what he wanted to do.  ||| This story makes me so so sad.... As someone who also grew up in the system, I can strongly relate. It's sad that America has not figured out a better and more safe system to handle kid's without parents or with parents who are unfit. A lot of the times, the system is no better, or even worse than the situation kids were in before, and I think this story is a good example of that.  ||| I hate hearing stories like this... I feel so bad for veterans, not only for what they have to deal with if they were on the battlefield, but because of the lack of respect for them in this country. Even if you don't agree with the war we are fighting, that is not their fault, don't take it out on them, take it out on their leaders.  ||| It's sad that humans have the destroyed/damaged the world to the point that it is starting to give us cancer! How crazy sad is that... Why can't we find more enviormentally friendly ways to do things? I'm sure the ways are out there, but theres no money in it so they haven't been discovered yet...  how gross is that ||| This kind of thing makes me so sad to hear... I can't believe things like this are still happening in todays day and age, after all the advancements that humanity has made as far as technology, racism, sexism, classism, and this kind of thing still is going on... It's awful and it's sad that we don't hear more about it in the media.  ||| This is crazy to me that this sort of stuff is going on right now in the US over oil/money... Shooting a kids horse?? That sounds like something that would have happened in medieval times or the 1800s or something, not 2020. This is so sad... adn this has been going on for far to long. A generation is growing up in this.  ||| Poor  animals! But at least it sounds like the government is involved in helping stop the spreading of this thing. I hope people who have ponds or want ponds in their yard will be made aware or make themselves aware of the danger of this, and how to prevent it as well as stop the spread. That is the only way this will get better ||| I never really think about immigration outside of the US, but the more I hear and think about it, the more I realize  just what an issue it is globally. People all over the world are being effected by it on both ends. Both ends being the people immigrating, and the other being the people living in the countries that people are immigrating to  ||| This is truly disgusting. I will never be able to understand how someone, especially a parent, is able to even fathom doing this to their kid. It is disgusting. I can only imagine the daily horrors that this poor women has to live with thanks to her disgusting parents. I can't believe they only for 20 years. they should be in their for life so this poor women does not have to feel scared or worried with them out of prison.   ||| How sad and awful of a tragedy is this. I know accidents happen but surely there were steps in place, or steps that could have been put in place to prevent this. How horrifying of a sight it must have been to see charred bodies tossed in the air like that and being thrown all over the ground. That is something that will haunt whoever survived it for the rest of their lives.  ||| These kind of stories make me sad, but it sounds like it could have been so much worse!! Of all the people that could have been in an apartment complex, for no one to die and for only ten to be injured, that seems like pretty good luck all in all to me. Especially considering only 2 were hurt bad enough to go to the hospital.  ||| This makes me so sad.... Especially because it totally could have been prevented if the right safety precautions would have just been taken. 23 lives. That's a lot. That's 23 families who will never be the same. All because it sounds like the heads in charge were lazy and taking the easy shortcuts out.  ||| This man is truly disgusting.... My heart breaks for these poor girls and what they went through and what they will have to continue to go through as victims and survivors. I hope they know that this is not their fault and it is all on him. He made the choice. I'm sure the media will portray it how they usually do and try to put some blame on them, but it is not their fault at all.  ||| This story is so sad! I can't imagine the horror and pain that the boy suffered in his last moments of life... It must have been so scary to be there all alone, proibably knowing or feeling that you are going to die. And then I also feel bad for the workers trying to get to him... how devastating must it have been to find him dead.  ||| This story is just depressing. Why can a country as advanced as the US be advanced in gender equality as well. As a women in the workforce it just is depressing to even think about. Why can't equal wages be discovered and demanded? It can't be that hard. And why can't more opportunity be given to women?  ||| I hate reading these kinds of articles!! The unfair pay for women is so annoying. It's crazy that it is even still a thing with how much attention has been brought to it over the last couple of years. It's like people just dont care. Or at least the people in charge don't care. Probably because it would effect their paycheck ||| I hate reading stories like this... Poor animals made to suffer the abuse of stupid people. I'll never get where people get off hurting a defenseless animal for no reason. Like what did this flamingo ever do to that dude? Why does he think this is ok? I'm sure he suffered some sort of trauma as a child.  ||| IS this was ever going to end? It seems like it has been going on forever and we have tried and tried to help them, to fix this or to end it even but nothing is working. It seems like two steps forward one step back. I can only imagine the trauma the people/soilders around this event felt. It's disgusting and I wish it would end/  ||| I hate reading things about nuclear war and stuff! It's so scary... That kind of thing could literally destroy humanity. I would never want to think about what that could mean if this is really starting to happen or if this is a real option that people/countries are considering. I just wish that they had never been invented! ||| This is so sad to hear about... I really hope that they are able to find out, soon, the cause of the accident, as I'm sure this will give the victims, and their families, some sort of comfort. It also had to be traumatic for the people watching, to see such a thing happen and lives destroyed like that.  ||| This kind of stuff makes me sad to hear... I'm glad that it seems that he rose above it, but a kids life should never be this hard or sad. Kids should not have to worry about where their going to live or who their going to live with. They should just have to be kids, and focus on learning and growing.  ||| It's so sad to read this kind of story... Poor animals that can't really do much to defend themselves being destroyed, for what? Money? Greed? It's awfully sad. And in a country like India, it doesn't seem like the government is too interested in doing anything to fix or remedy this, so I bet it will just continue to get worse and worse.  ||| I think that this sounds like a kind of story that should not be happening anymore.... It seems so outdated and I don't get, with how far advanced we are, why this kind of stuff is still happening. Why are people still basing things on the Bible? Why aren't we actually studying things and using real stuff to develop as humans.  ||| I hate hearing stories like this... It really makes me nervous that elephants are going to go extinct. That generations will grow up never getting to see one in real life. And that a whole breed, of a beautiful amazing creature, will cease to exist soley because humans can be evil and selfish and cruel.  ||| It's interesting, I never thought about immigrants and such in another country besides the US, but obviously it is going to be happening anywhere with a border. It's sad that this is such an issue all around the globe. I know that immigrants have to be kept out to some extent and need to be handles, but it seems like there has to be a better way  ||| I dont think that any women, who is accusing someone of harassment should be immediately questioned/doubted. Innocent until proven guilty should be applied the other way around too. If we immediatly doubt a women when she is already dealing with trauma, that will make the whole thing worse for the case and for the women.  ||| When will we stop reading this kind of story? It's starting to break my heart... So much pain and suffering over war. Isn't there a more civil and humane way to end conflict? especially when it is over such materialistic things like money and oil and land. Human lives and their well being should always come first ||| Do you believe what is happening over there! It seems like the government and medical person ell are doing all that they can to help people, but not much is being done and it just continues to get worse. This leads to people thinking that nothing is being done and no one is being helped, even though they are! ||| I feel so bad for this girl... and I bet you money that people will try to victim blame or twist this story/circumstance to make it seem like her fault, because she smoked some weed and had a few drinks. Even thought neither of those things are ever deserving of being raped or assualted. But that is the sad way the world works/thinks ||| It seems like we hear about this sort of thing all the time! It's becoming way to common. When will he stop ruining our oceans and oceanlife! When will a measure be put in place to prevent this or to diminish the occurance of it. It seems like we hear abuout it all the time, but we never hear about the punishment or what is being done to fix it.  ||| I don't get why people think it's ok to act this way? Why would you hurt any sort of animal? It makes me wonder this guys mental state and what else he has done, because if he thinks this is ok to do to a flamingo out in the public, then what does he think it's ok to do to another animal or even a human behind closed doors?  ||| This kind of this is so so sad to read about! I can't imagine living somewhere like that, where destruction can just happen so suddenly. It would be nerve wracking. I can't imagine trying to recover after devestation like that either... it would be so hard. Those people are strong willed I will give them that!  ||| I can't imagine the kind of person that would do this to a sweet cute innocent kitten. Not only did they dump it on the side of the road, which is one kind of evil, but they tortured it in the process. Who ties up a kitten like that? It's so easy now a days if you don't want a kitten, put it on facebook or cragslist to get rid of it.  ||| I hate reading stories like this... I don't get how there are still people in the world that can do this to an innocent animal... And not even just dumping it on the side of the road, that's one thing, but tying it up just to make it suffer? That is some pretty sick stuff. This person obviously is not mentally sound ||| Another story about police brutality... I'm not surprised. While it does sound like this individual was giving the police a harder time than was needed, they are the professionals here and need to act like it. I don't think what she was doing warranted getting punched in the face. That is not a professional measure to subdue someone.  ||| I think things like this are terrifying, especially because it seems like things are just starting to heat up in Syria and we haven't even started sending that many troops over there. It makes me nervous that it's going to be another long war and one that will will fight for seemingly no real benefit of our own.  ||| I am definiltly guilty of wasting food. I buy it all with the best of intentions, but either don't use as much as I need, or end up eating out and not cooking at home a night or two  a week, thus wasting all the food I bought for those specific meals. It's definitly sad how much money and resources we was on this, where there really is very little reason forit.  ||| I wish this article had given us more info. Were there any people hurt? Where did this shooting take place exactly? I'm honestly a bit glad the guy killed himself, one because he can't hurt anyone else that way.  And two because that way a police officer does not have to deal with the trauma of killing someone.  ||| An option for this very well may be that the man was so drunk, and he was so out of it, that he went into his hotel room and banged around/fell or did something stupid to accidentally kill himself. He also could have very well done this on purpose too. Or the other option is that someone killed him. Either way, it's a sad waste of life. ","what did you think about this article ||| I think it's super sad... they seem to never catch a break, always struggling. ||| Me too.. I also can't imagine living in the poverty and such.. It's crazy to think that people still live like that sometimes.  The gap between first world countires and places like that is crazy to em ||| Agreed... with how frivilous and unnessary our spending is, it's so sad that countries like that don't get more support or guidance. ||| It is so sad... Or even the millionaires/billionaires out there. I know some of them donate, but at some point, you can only spend so much money. Why not put it to use. ||| It is hard to fathom/process, it's hard for me to really imagine ||| I think that is a fair statement... the new generation seems more caring and compassionate and willing to help ||| I totally agree... I know there are some out there that care, but the majority, and the ones in charge, really don't seem to ||| we don't have enough lines yet ||| Haha no worries, we should be there now. That sounds about right to me, crazy, time flies, seems like I was just hearing about it ||| I kinda remember that too...Well it has been great talking to you! bye :) ||| What did you think about this article ||| It makes me sad too... ||| It is... seems so dangerous. ||| That is true... It's hard to think about.. I hope there was no suffering for him. I hope it was quick as could be. ||| Yes I would hope... Did he have much family did it say? ||| Oh yah that's right... Poor lady. It must be hard with no real closure, so suddenly like that ||| I would hope so for her sake, and I';m sure he has other family down there ||| Yah... his mom shouldn't have to deal with travelling to a new foreign country on top of her grieving ||| That's true I didn't think about that... I bet they will be good support for her ||| And I'm sure they'd like to get to know his mom more, now that he is not around. See where he came from kind og ||| It has been for me as well! goodbye :) ||| What did you think about this article ||| I agree... it's such a bad system sometimes and it breaks my heart, cause they are kids ||| Agreed, I'm sure he would be less likely to do that if he  had grown up in more stable conditions. It seems a lot of times the foster care system puts them in a situation that is just as bad or worse then where they wer ebefore ||| Oh that's so sad... My neighbors did foster care a lot, and they were a great family. but man some of the kids you could tell had been through some shit and they were so angry. ||| Agreed, I'm sure it would put a strain on any family or couple, especially if the kids are a handful ||| for sure! I just wish he could have been helped out more in the process, or for it to be easier on him ||| Agreed.... I can't imagine being that kind of parent. i don't get people who are. But there seems to be so many ||| For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids ||| For sure... it seems everyone has parent problems, but then seem to end up parenting the same way ||| That is a great way to phrase it... It's very interesting for sure. Especially when you have 18+years to change ||| I don't, but my husband and I are trying ||| thank you! haha my husband felt that way for a while... It's scary for  sure the thought of bringing another human into this world ||| Thank you! I sure will try haha ||| bye ||| I think it's sad that a kid would have to go through all that... ||| Agreed, he should just be allowed to be a kid and not have to deal with all that ||| Oh yah, he'll definitly have the trauma of it all to deal with the rest of his life ||| I think he needs therapy and guidance and  a stable home more so than punishment/jail ||| Childhood tramua? ||| Yah and I bet that is the case for a lot of people... how sad ||| I agree... It's so sad because he has already missed out on so so much of his childhood, and had it be horrible, and now this. He just needs a break and someone who actually cares about him ||| I hope so too, and that he is able to hold a healthy relationship ||| Probably way too many ||| you as well, bye ||| I think it is sad as well... Poor elephants ||| Well yes poor people too, it's sad all around. sad there isn't more help being given out ||| Agreed... that is their job afterall ||| Yes, to deter it and to show people that it is wrong... It's sad what greed will do to people ||| Can you imagine living with yourself knowing you did that? ||| No... it would eat me alive ||| I don't get how people do it... they have to be mentally ill or unsound ||| I hope it catches up to all of them and they have to go through some of the suffering they have put those people and animals through ||| I hope so..... They deserve it ||| bye ||| Do you mean to like their homeland? ||| Yah.. I never really thought about it either but it makes total sense ||| I agree... which is sad to think about. How long will those peopel continue to suffer? and the people trying to help suffering as well ||| and it could be fixed! There is the funds out there in the world, and the know how. ||| These stories just make me think/realize the massive gap that there is in the world ||| For sure, it reminds me to take a step back and just be grateful for what I have ||| and the people who go to help, I'm sure they will struggle with what they saw/did etc for the rest of their life... ||| Yes and they shouldn't have to make that kkind of choice over faith.. it's silly ||| Yes, which is their choice I guess ||| I don't either, everyone is entitled to their own opinion ||| bye ||| Hi; I thought the article was pretty accurate. ||| I can't even imagine what it would be like to be at war, or in the services in general. ||| I agree. We should take better care of our servicemen and women. ||| We should also not enter needless wars and send them away unnecessarily. It's too common. ||| They're just pawns in a big political game. ||| Agreed. I don't believe they're really \defending our freedom\"" and I wish young kids would stop joining for the recognition."" ||| That, too. And bribed- crazy amounts of money, travel, free education... ||| 100%. I can't imagine just following someone else's orders blindly. ||| That's terrible. You definitely got a firsthand view. My secondhand view isn't very favorable, either. ||| I imagine. That would be traumatizing. ||| It would be really hard coming back and adjusting. And hard for the families, too, obviously. ||| I can't believe so many are homeless after making so much money while serving. Where does it go? ||| what did you think about this article ||| It was... cancer is such a sad subject no matter what ||| I don't get why it has not been cured yet ||| I think so too, because there is so so much money in it ||| I agree... Curing it would mean a big drop in profits for them... how awful is that ||| It's so sad that people would rather see $$$ than human lives being saved and improved ||| It shouldn't have to be thouh ||| There is too much of that mentatllity I agree, but that doesn't mean we should be punished by having treatments hidden from us for the sake of the rich getting richer ||| We are pretty helpless ||| what war? ||| What do you think is going to cause that ||| That usually is a starter for it ||| bye ||| I think it's very sad... hbu ||| me too. All animals do! It's scary to think about them going extinct ||| Im sure they can, i bet they aren't for financial gain or something ||| Probably, if enough people rallied against it they could make a change for the better ||| That is a good side of it, that very well could be... How sad really. Encouraging killing endangered animals for $$ ||| Im sure they could... but lots of people dont even see it as an issue... it's \just an animal\"""" ||| it would be! And it would just be an awful step for humanity, killing off another species ||| I think they probably do but they don't have much pull ||| it's awful that that is the way the world works ||| you as well bye ||| what did you think about this artivel\\ ||| It is... and it's awful that it's caused by humans ||| For sure... but I don't think that will happen for a long time... and people will continue to get sick and suffer because of it ||| That would help ||| most peopel probably don't, it's not well known I don't think ||| Haha probably because the government doesn't want us talking about it ||| For sure! It's insane, something that is soley for saving humans and helping them stay/get healthy has turned into corruption and greed ||| My friend had jaw cancer, and couldn't afford the surgery he needed until it got so bad that they had to remove his salviarly glands and lower jaw... So he'll never really be able to eat normal food again ||| He didn't have any was his main problem and he couldn't get on medicaid ||| why are you getting kicked off? I'm sorry... ||| oh that sucks... I'm kind of in the same situation, so I just don't have health insurance. It's scary! ||| you as well! bye ||| what did you think about this article ||| Me too! I hope it continues to grow ||| Oh really? i didn't even know they couldn't... how crazy is that that it just barely happened... ||| That's so sad... But I am really glad they finally got the right! ||| Yikes for sure... I hope that as the older generations \age out\"" we will see some of that opposition fade away"" ||| Yes it's crazy how not long ago that kind of racism exsisted. ||| For sure... Like I saw on FB the other day that the first african american child that was allowed into an all white school just turned like 68 or something... how crazy is that ||| But it's good knowing that things are changing ||| Me too... Hopefully no war or civil war is started over any of it ||| you are probably right ||| haha... It's good that this stuff is becoming more prevelant in the media.. keep the folks aware of real things ||| no I didn't.. it's been nice talking!. bye ||| I thought it was interesting... I never really hear about immigration outside the US border stuff ||| It is scary for sure... but yes they have their rights, and I get it... I just wish there were better ways to deal with this kind of things ya knwow ||| That would be interesting... or even just a more streamlined, human based process ||| For sure, it's got to be a crazy crazy workload.... ||| The other sad thing is, think how many other people have had similar or worse experiences then this guy ||| It also sucks that there is such a negative connotation with it all because of the people who come over illegaly ||| And the people in charge just want to waste money and time on building walls and \blocking\"" them from coming in instead of making it possible for them to come in and be productive members of society"" ||| agreed, it could be helpful, but it seems there are other actions we could be taking ||| Like streamlining the process of imigration and making it more attainable. Streamline the process of becoming a citizen if you are already residing in the US. If their already living here, why not collect taxes from them? ||| you as well bye ||| what did you think about thi ||| It's super sad... and crazy that this is a current thing. It sounds like it should be from the 1800s or somethign ||| Probably because they would loose money over it ||| Yes they had limited options for sure ||| I know that was the part that got me! Not only the horse's life, but that child will be scarred! It's a barbaric action almost ||| For sure, there was no reason for it to happen other than brute force ||| Totally agree, they did not have to do that either ||| Yah... that's a good point. The whole situation should have just never happened... it's sad that kids are growing up like this ||| yes its sad ||| Really? I hear about this story but I have not followed it very well ||| That sukcs... ||| you as well! bye ||| what did you think about this article ||| me too! Poor things ||| Yes... we always seem to ||| Probably... we aren't very aware of our enviroment ||| It sounds like the governemtn is trying to make people aware, but also that they could be doing more ||| yes, or even at places that sell ponds, make it madatory that they come with some sort of info panfelt ||| yah that way it will reach everyone who is getting one or updating theirs ||| that would help also ||| Yes they've got to be suffering ||| I wonder if anyone is working on finding one ||| that's true, we need them around ||| you too! bye ||| I think that it's sad she was questioned and doubted what seems like right off the bat ||| pretty much yah... innocent until proven guilty, just flipped right ||| You have to assume that first yes. and then investigate and go from there. If you doubt initiallly what does that do to the victim if it is legit ||| same visa versa though, what does it do to the victim? I think what you're saying about remaining neutral is smart... But you have to think like, you call the cops and tell them your house got robbed, and they start off with doubt. Their not gonna pour all the effort they could into solving this for you.The doubt needs to be based on facts just like the belief ||| agreed, I think he's guilty too. I feel bad for her... lifelong thing to deal with ||| i wonder why she did that ||| Those are both valid points, could have been both. I'd probably feel/act the same way I think ||| Agreed, that guy needed to be stopped from being able to do this again. Very strong of her to do! ||| for sure... People can be awful. ||| you too! bye ||| I think it's sad... ||| Yes, and it seems like for no reason ||| Yes sorry my internet is being weird. I wouldhate living there... and hate having to go to war over there ||| For sure... it's crazy that things like this are still going on in today's day and age ||| Agreed! It seems never ending... and there is no end in sight ||| Me neither... like why is it even going on? what are we fighting over ||| There has to be more to it! And why are we putting oil above human lives... it's awful ||| It would be so awfull... and having children there. I can't imagine the stress ||| I wouldn't even want to have kids ||| you as well bye ||| what did you think about this article ||| That is interesting that there might be another side to this article, it didn't really elude to that ||| It does seem a bit biased, like they are trying to pull at our sympathy. How did the French government handle it? ||| That's crazy... so it seems like both parties could be at fault ||| It's weird that this had a biased article. All the ones I've done have seemed not so ||| Interesting... Either way... the kids is what get me. They did nothing and do not deserve what is happening to them/going on around them ||| Interesting... I think their banking on the kids aspect is what's grabbing peoples attention and putting the sympathy vote on them ||| Probably a mix of both... Can you imagine growing up in that kind of tramau? ||| Oh no I hope they aren't dead... ||| That or they are not there for their children, which is sad as well ||| BYE ||| sorry caps was on. bye ||| I thought it was a little aggressively written but it got the point across. ||| Me too... It's sad too that people try so hard to help, like those doctors and stuff, but there will always be some \bad guy\"" undoing that and making things worse it seems."" ||| Yes, they must feel very hopeless ||| Yah not people like you or me... At some point it has to be up to the higher ups and the people in charge over there. ||| Agreed... How long has this kind of stuff even been going on? it seems like forever ||| Me too! Do you live in the US? ||| Same! It definitely makes you appreciate countries like are more when you think about what it could be. ||| Yes I went to Germany once and some of the surrounding countries. They were all really nice and full of culture. I haven't been to any like none 1st world countries. Hbu? ||| Yah that makes sense, did you go to like the touristy areas? ||| bye! ||| What did you think about this article ||| Agreed! It's awful. I can't believe they only got 20 years. ||| No I think if someone is evil enough to do that, that evil can't go away. They may have buried it or learned to hide it, but that is evil at it core. ||| Exactly! Yah that seems like a grab for views which is sad on Dr Phils part. He should have focused on the abusee and trying to help her. ||| Ew that's true, I didn't even think about them profitting. That's even worse. I wonder if the daughter will even think it's worth it at that point ||| yah thats true ||| That's true, usually people with childhood tramua such as that struggle with holding steady jobs and their finances. So she probably doesn't want the whole world to know those secrets but now they do because she needs the money most likely. ||| True a good mother would like divorce or be strongly against the husband/father for even bringing that up in the first place. I would be beyond disgusted if my husband said anything like that ||| Agreed... she is just as at fault as she is. Parents are supposed to protect, not enable or roll over and let evil things happen ||| Agreed. It's been great talking but I think we at 20+ turns right? ||| goodbye ||| What did you think about this artivel ||| Me too... i wonder how long they could feel it for before they died ||| yah that sounds awful.... I wonder if this could have been preventsed ||| I agree... I hope they do something to prevent this happeneing again ||| Agreed... and think of all the people that saw the even happen. I bet they are traumatized. ||| hopefully the government or that company offer some. ||| Yes for sure... they shouldn't have to pay any of those bills ||| that's true... do you think there are laws in place that will make them pay for this? I hope so ||| that was kind of my thoughts too.... and those people who that happened too were probably not well off... ||| it's awful.... and even worse that with not a lot of laws in place probably, this could happen again and again ||| agreed. then maybe bigger countries could chime in an help. would you like to keep talking for 5 more turns ||| i thnk so too because they have the experience ||| exactly. what else could they do to help you think? send like guidance people down ||| that's a good idea. And we could send them down to prevent events like that not just after them ||| that would be great. I wonder if anythign like that is in place already? Probably is but it's not that great ||| agreed! it's been nice talking to you goodbye ||| what did you think about this article ||| Right? I thought it would be way worse initially. Still sad but could have been so so much worse ||| Same...I wonder what caused it ||| I dont think so.... and yah that would seem most common. I wonder if anyone will sue the landlord. I would haha ||| That's true.... I've always had bad landlords, but if it were a nice guy who I knew I might think twice and just be glad it wasn't worse ||| true, it would not be worth it for simple things like some inhalation. ||| Maybe like debris flying or something like that? It said minor so they probably just got knicked with something ||| That would make sense yah, which is good. It probably means the building was like set up like it was supposed to be, safety wise and all ||| Hopefully they did, i didn't think about that. I hope there is some sort of law or policy in place that the landlord would have to pay for a hotel for them or something ||| Hopefully so... it didn't have much detail on all that. and hopefully not a lot of people's stuff was ruined! that would suck ||| I know! To just have it all be gone in a moment, no warning. That would really really suck, on top of being injured and not having a place to stay. ||| Same here....and those things can't be brought back with time or money. ||| do you want to go for like three more turns to get the bonus? We could talk about insurance on it and stuff ||| When I had mine it did, and it would cover the cost to replace any damaged or destroyed items ||| I hope so too... I know a lot of my friends who rent don't. Which is silly cause it's like 10 bucks a month. They probably could get it covered by the property owners insurance ||| Oh yes that would have been awful! Even just for the peace of mind it's worth it. I think that is 15 turns. Are you ready to be done? ||| you too! goodbye! ||| what did you think about this articel ||| I think it's awful... So much loss. and it could have been prevented ||| Agreed, and they could be so much safer if they had just put in the vetilation. But they were trying to be cheap. ||| 23 humans... that's a small number but think about that. 23 whole people. 23 families. all so someone could get a little bit richer. ||| Yup.. and somebody lost a son or grandson ||| I hope something will be done to punish those people that caused this ||| Yah they do have a track record of that... Probably pay someone off or something ||| Yes, the poorer ones, where the officials in charge have way too much power ||| For sure... so sad, money over human lives ||| And the two people who survived, I bet they are traumatized ||| goodbye ||| What did you think about this article ||| Interesting how? They changed their mind because he started choking them and being aggressive ||| They were having consensual sex. and then changed their mind. There is nothing wrong with that. are you trying to blame them? ||| No people need to know what the words \no\"" and \""stop\"" mean. Simple as that."" ||| I mean if you think it's neccesary but you'd have to be pretty bad at understanding situations. I just hope you are not trying to blame these girls. he RAPED them. It's all on him ||| OK and I could agree with that for the most part. ||| and I get that, and those are the iffy situations especially if both parties are drunk. But those aren't the majority of cases. and then it's mindsets like that that can hurt or delay the real victims getting the help they need ||| I agree with the second part of that yah... They are doing an injustice to the real victims. ||| Yup... but that is the same kind of case with a lot of things. Like that chick who spilt hot coffee all over her and sued mcdonalds. A lot of people tried to follow in suit for silly things like that, and it made real suing cases seem less real ||| haha yup ||| yup. And it makes it harder than it should be for the real victims. ||| I feel bad for these girls though... because see like we were talking about, some of the first thougths were \maybe they were lying or weren't sure\"""" ||| bye ||| I think that it's a sad story it seems like we hear all too often... ||| Agreed... I really hope people don't try to victime blame this poor woman ||| Totally! if you are evil enough to do it once, you'll do it again ||| Yes, so even more reason... I don't get how someone can be that evil ||| They could be, or how they were raised im sure plays a big role ||| Me too... And I hope the women he hurt get justice ||| They might be.. but knowing he's behind bars and got what he deserves might help ||| I think rage or evilness... like they want to hurt people ||| Agreed... it's so barbaric and unhumane ||| bye ||| what did you thingk about this article ||| It's super sad... I can't imagine what that little boy went through ||| I hope so too, I wish the article had said... ||| It is... I feel bad for the workers too... It must have been devastating to find ||| I wondered that too... And yes that would be so so hard to live with ||| I think so too... ||| Honestly same here.... I could never stop thinking about the what ifs... Or how long he lived for down there. ||| I'm glad thought that the workers did all they could... it's good they tried ||| Which I'm sure made it harder to find that boy. the way he was... but easier to live with knowing they did all they could ||| me too ||| you as well! bye ||| what did you think about this article ||| me too, i was surprised that it is growing, as that is not what i see in field ||| Yup... I don't get why it can't be implented or why there cant' be some sort of check in place ||| You'd think... I also think it's sad that a country as advanced as the US can't figure it out. It should be a priority. We are 51% of the country afterall ||| Agreed, especially in this area. IMO it's because there are so many more men running the country than women. It is just not as important to them ||| Yes that is true, there are physcial limitations that are harder for women to achieve in some jobs. BUt they should still have an opportunity at them ||| I also think it's sad women aren't advancing in their careers as much as men. All the women i know in power positions work just as hard or harder than their male counterparts ||| Yes... probably longer than everyone would like. It makes me sad as a women in the workforce, trying to advance. ANd I am in Electrical so it's a very male driven workforce ||| Thank you! It is a great caree ||| yes it does! ||| haha it is kind of scary at first! But once you get shocked a time or too i think your body realizes it's not that bad. Luckily right now I do residential so there isn't a ton of high voltage ||| you as well :) bye! ||| what did you think about this read ||| Agreed... there's no real rhyme or reason this is still such an issue ||| That is a good viewpoint... I also feel like the disadvantage of it only being half the species dealing with the gap plays a role ||| for sure! And fixing the gap could result in lower pay for them, so why would they want to help fix it ||| That's interesting to hear... makes sense though ||| I think that head people should be making it known that they are actively working on it, and actually do so ||| I think both, but mainly with businesses and such ||| Agreed... There'd almost have to be some sort of incentive ||| yah exatly ||| I think it is a very big goal, that we would have to go about slowly... unfortunately ||| bye ||| I think that it's sad... it makes me worry more and more about the ocean. what did you think ||| Me too... I wish the goverments would do more to prevent this ||| Agreed. IT seems like we never hear about the aftermath of this or the punishment ||| Right? They are all over it if it's their paycheck on the line, but things liek this seem to have no resolution in sight\\ ||| Or we are... I just wish that people wouldn't forget about this stuff a week after it happens. We need to stay on it and care about it and force them to change something ||| Oh yah, I think that was the one that kind of like first started the trend of them appearinig in the news. I can't remember the name of it. started with an O? ||| Yah I remember that... it probably wwas like it is now... A big fuss and first and then everyone forgot so they did nothing ||| very sad.... i wonder if theres an organazition for this sorta stuff. you'd think there would be ||| yah. Then there could be like  a task force when this sort of stuff happens ||| I could probably look into it online and see. There might already be one. I wouldn't be surprised! ||| I think i will look into it haha cause no I am curious. ||| Yes i'm glad we talked about all this. It's kind of interesting to talk in depth about stuff and think about it more than base level. ||| yes and hear new ideas or get some different opinions ||| yes very true!! ||| I had a great chat with you as well! Goodbye ||| I think it's sad... I don't get why people do stuff like that ||| Me neither... Do you think his punishment was fair/ ||| I would agree for the most part... I think therapy or something else should be required too, because that is not the actions of an OK person ||| Yes that's a good idea too. ||| I have no idea, but I would assume that's an older flamingo, probably getting up there in age. ||| Aw they probably will miss him I did not think about that. ||| I'm sure most animals can mourn in some sense.... That's sad. I also worry for the people around this guy. Because if he thinks that is ok to do in public, what does he think is ok to do behind closed doors? ||| Me too.... I'm sure for him to do that in public, he has done something like that before in private ||| I wonder if there's some mental illness going on ||| Yah I don't want to sterotype either, just throwing it out there. Maybe he has suffered some sort of abuse, so his mind is more prone to thinking those actions areok ||| For sure.... ||| you too! bye ||| what did you think about this read ||| i have no idea... some kind of evil in him ||| agreed... he killed an animal, for no reason, in public. Should have been a way harsher punisshment ||| I've never been there... do you think there were a lot of people around when he did it? ||| That would be awful... People have become so disassociated ||| Yup... all trapped behind screens. We're all so desensitzed ||| Right? It's like people see them as just another normal news story ||| Yah I've noticed that too... We either think they are not deserving of help or think that we'renot in a position to help, when most likely we are ||| Yes! But no one can afford help for their mental illness! Minimum wage hasn't gone up in 10 years... how crazy is that ||| Me too... but yet we as a country seem to be able to afford to help other countries ||| you too! bye ||| what did you think about this artivel ||| My thoughts too! It seems like it's been going on forever ||| Yes which is not a good thing.... ||| That is a good way of putting it. I'm sure MOST of those soilders have good intentions but there could be some ill advised things hire up. And it's those civillians paying the consequences. ||| Oh no that's awful if it's true. I would think that would be a war crime yah ||| What kind of foreign policy ||| Oh yes I totally think it does. it gives them motives ||| It would be unimaginably awful..> and like you said, for what? Most americans can't tell you. I cant really ||| I have heard something along those lines as well. You'd think the media would keep us more informed haha ||| I totally agree. that and memes, pointless celebrity news and drama, all to keep our focus off the important stuff, so they can make decisions and changes behind our back. ||| bye! ||| For real... It's so hard to read about ||| Right? With how advanced we are in other countries, it's crazy to still see a country struggling like this ||| I have heard that a lot of times... That they do what is best for them, even if it costs the lives of their own ||| How awful is that... ||| That's very true... at least we don't generally die because of it ||| That's a valid point... and workplace stress too... We have such a lack of working laws for being a developed country ||| Right? It's crazy how anti union places are. LIke it makes sense, for the business, but not for the individual workers supporting them. ||| Yes... but at our cost ||| Honestly I have no idea.. it seems overwhelming to try to start as just one person ||| bye ||| what did you think about htis read ||| I think it's sad and scary ||| nuclear war terrifies me ||| I hope not! It seems like countriies are always on the verge of using it ||| That is true... but if one dumb leader got angry enough think about what couldhappen ||| Me neither.... like the entire worlds fate in one persons hand.. doesn't make sense ||| Oh yah for sure.... ||| Yes I worry about that too... So many things oculd go wrong ||| that's definitely a possibility ||| Not in the near future no... ||| well it has been great chatting! goodbye ||| I know it's awful... ||| Like dumping a kitten is one thing, but wrapping it up the way he did? That's evil ||| Ew I didn't even think about that. It could be ||| Yah... I just don't get it. They  can feel pain just as much as us... ||| I mean I think that all causes should be represented. Given children are more important, but animals need a voice too. ||| That is true, but you have to think, their drive is now for saving animals. They'll be more passionate and productive in that aspect. People are going to do what their going to do,i'll just be happy its a good thing they're doing. ||| That is hard to think about... But I think i could come to the same conclusion. ||| I agree with that as well.. I think the amount americans spend on unneccary animal stuff is crazy when there are people starving to death or can't afford medical stuff ||| I know, it's kind of crazy. I do think that we should still take care of animals and care about them, but not to the extent that a lot of people do. Like don't buy your dog a sweater or halloween outfit. Donate to a charity or something. ||| bye! ||| It's super sad... I don't get how someone can do that to a cute kitten... hbu ||| I want them to find this person and punish him ||| like dropping it on the side of the raod is one thing... but tying it up just to hurt it is evil ||| I'm glad someone found it though ||| probably quite a bit... that had to have been hard to see ||| me too.... ||| Or even easier access to help for mental health... the person who did this obviously has issue ||| Do you think the police will do anything to find the guy ||| honestly could.. or he could start hurting people or his family if he has one ||| bye ||| I think i've heard way too many of these stories.. ||| I could be on eitherdepending on the situation. ||| agreed. It does sound like she was being unneccasrily resistant, but a punch to the face is still not a professional way to subdue someone. ||| yes, it probably added tension for everyne ||| Yah... I just think a punch is so aggressive. They are trained in how to take people down, and I'm sure a punch to the face is not part of that so much ||| Yes, there are so many other options ||| agreed... I hope the officer gets some sort of reprimand ||| We can hope! It seems like they dont sometimes ||| Yes probably... I hope the women got some sort of like... not apology... but some sort of reconcilliation for it ||| exactly ||| you as well bye ||| It made me feel concerned. ||| Becuase it seems like this is going to be another very long, deathly war that we are fighting for who knows what reason ||| The war that is starting in Syria... America is starting to send troops over there. How did this article make you feel ||| You sound knowledgeable on this subject. That makes sense though... Do you think there is any resolution in the near future for this war? ||| That is a gruesome statement.... hard to think about. But it makes sens ||| That sounds very unfair for the people living in that country... Sad that this still goes on and there is no real end in sight. ||| How do you know so much about all this? It's interesting to learn all this, as my knowledge is lacking in that area, as Im sure you can tell ||| Good for you! We could all stand to be more aware of what is going on in the world. It's so easy to avoid, because it is sad. ||| It is... It's crazy with how far we have come as a human race, we have more or less stayed the same in a lot of ways. ||| vye ||| sorry, bye ||| what did you think about this article ||| Same here.... I hope they can find out what caused it ||| I've actually never ridden one so I can't relate. But I'm sure it would make me more nervous if I was... ||| I just live in a small town, we can drive everywhere so we do. I dont think there even is any sort of like passenger trains, just stock ones ||| Yah I flew to Europe once! So do you ride trains for like commuting? Or travel? ||| That does sound convenient. Do you drive a lot on your own then? ||| Me too... That's another reason I hope they can find out the cause, is to give the families some sort of closure or reasoning. It would suck not knowing. ||| I hope so too... I also feel bad for the people that witnessed the incident. That had to have been tramautizign ||| Me too... and the people injured, that would be evne worse. Probably left thinking \what if\"""" ||| Probably a lot less developed ||| you too! bye ||| I agree! It's insane... But I definitly do it myself and it's something I need to work on ||| That is a good point... If I knew where to take food that I knew I wasn't going to use, I definitly would. ||| Do food banks accept food like that? I'm not sure ||| No worries :) Interesting... But i guess that kind of makes sense. I'm sure it's the same here in Idaho ||| Yes, convenience is key in getting people to help out. Those numbers definitly make me think twice about what I'm buying when grocery shopping. ||| That's not a bad idea... I usually don't follow the use by dates either, I've read they can be scammy, just to get you to buy more ||| Me too! Think how much we could save as a whole! Money and resources ||| That is so sad... With how much food we have, nobody should be going hungry. ||| It's awful... And there's no reason for it. Why can't we donate just a bit of money? Rice and beans, oatmeal. It's all nourishing and cheap ||| Right? People need to need every other day of the year too. ||| I've heard that too... LIke these company's CEOs are millionaires or billionaires ||| Really?? That's awful ||| That's so sad... the rich get richer while the poor continue to suffer and strrve ||| you as well! bye ||| i thought it lacked info... but it was sad ||| and how many people were hurt ||| Yah... I'm honestly kind of glad he killed himself ||| agreed... and that way money/time isn't wasted on him ||| right? They have better healthcare than I do ||| did you know we spend $80 a day on each prisoner ||| yah! More than some people make in  a dya ||| minimum wage/part time ||| I know.. it's sad. I used to make less than that! The world is so backwards sometimes ||| bye ||| What did you think about thsi read ||| it totally is! Crazy that it is happening in such a develped country ||| Right? and why is this even an issue... Clean drinking water isn't a luxury. IT should have been solved asap ||| Right?? and it's sad nobody has really covered it this is the first im hearing of it ||| right? what if the water we are drinking right now is poisonous ||| haha it is wierd to think about ||| Yes me too ||| hopefully! And hopefully soon for the poor people living there ||| yah.... i hope people can get out of there ||| that's true ||| bye ||| I'm not sure really... My gut says accident ||| I just can see  a drunk person doing something dumb alone in a hotel room to get himself hurt/killed. I dont think I had enough info tho to know for sure haha ||| Ohhh I didn't catch that part.. That does make me more suspicious of foul play then ||| I can see foul play then.. And the people involved in that would have the know how to keep it clean and under wraps ||| You think somebody would have heard something with all that going on ||| Maybe he was passed out when they did it? from drinking? ||| That's a good persepective... Maybe they took him somewhere for questioning ||| Could be yah...Poor guy, what a sad thing to die over. ||| yah I don't think he was either :( ||| Probably at that age... or even if he didn't have his own, his mom and stuff probably were still alive... It's sad that people will kill over that, if that is what happened. ||| I don't ||| you too! bye"
p020,It is so sad that someone who had such an amazing story died in such a freak accident. His life was filled with amazing triumphs only for him to die in such a sad way. It is truly heart breaking to think about. He came from nothing and truly got the american dream. He died in such a rare and crazy way that it is so sad. ||| In Valenzuela the animals in the zoo are starving.. The staff cannot afford to feed them many days. This is so sad and disturbing. These poor animals have no freedom and cannot go anywhere to find food. That is torture and wrong. Someone needs to step into this sad situation before it gets any worse.  ||| A zoo named world zoo was the home to many suffering animals. This zoo was located on the Gaza strip. Very bad circumstances lead to animals dying of hunger. thankfully a rescue group made it's way there to rescue these poor animals. they did not deserve to live in such a bad place where there was no food. it is truly sad. ||| California researchers studied lung cancer patients for 10 years between 1999 and 2009. This research showed the those patients who lived in higher pollution rates were more negatively effected than those who did not live in higher pollution. they recommend for patients to move to places where there is less pollution. ||| this situation is so sad. The things that are going on in syria break my heart Reading the terrible unimaginable story of children covered in dust and blood is so sad. Reading that children are being killed along with hundreds of others is so sad. This is truly a horrible situation that needs more attention so more can help. ||| a man killed his family in a murder suicide. his wife had confessed to being abused on facebook. she was very close to leaving when she was murdered. they also had a few children together. this entire situation is so disturbing and sad. the fact that she was so close to escaping this situation but never got to breaks my history. ||| This situation in Haiti is terrible and saddening. no person in this day and age should suffer at the hands of their government while no one does anything to help. It is sad to see such suffering and hungry people. How can a country be that terrible. How does next to nobody help these poor innocent people. ||| This is such a sad reality we live in now a days. When all you want to do is have fun for one night and forget the stresses in life this happens. In was nice of the band to show up to the memorial that honored all of the victims. It is so sad to think about this happening. Those poor people were just trying to have fun. ||| The first female attorney general passed away at the age of 78. She had long battled parkinsons disease. This is very sad. She worded under Bill clintons presidency. She had so many accomplishments over the years. Her predecessor Eric Holder praised her work. She was an example for many women who struggle to find there path with sexism. ||| There is a very bad humanitarian crisis gong on in Afghanistan. The fighting has lead this this insanely bad crisis. There is so much war going on that the innocent people are caught in the middle of it all. It is so sad because theres not enough bring done so all of the innocent people are suffering. Something needs to be done. ||| It id very troubling how many innocent people are dying from events that did not need to happen. The air stroke that struck the wrong area and accidentlally hit a hospital killing dozens really seems sketchy. There is no regard for human life and that is truly scary. We never hear about this in the new and it is just a normal occurrence there. ||| The whole situation is sketchy. The wavering rulings of death is weird. From blunt force trauma to heart attack and alcohol poisonoing. It just does not make any sense this totally look like a cover up in my opinion. There have been known instances where Russia has attempted to kill people they did not want to release information.,"It was such an eye opener about the suffering that happens that you never hear about ||| right i can't believe it. If that was the US they would be set up to avoid fsilure ||| true, i heard in puerto rico they did not even distrubute the hurricane supplies the US gave them ||| o wow that is very embarrassing and degrading ||| probably a power trip or an i'm better than you moment ||| I think they should do a telethon get a bunch of celebrities and make a hashtag. encourage people to donate and volunteer ||| ahh so true!also insure that when you say there is enough for everyone that there actually is. ||| America should dethrone the government and make it the 51st state ||| hopefully these people get the help they need i am going to look into it after this ||| so crazy the suffering that is going on that we have no idea about ||| i agree makes my troubles seem so small ||| i agree. it was so nice chatting with you. goodbye ||| what a sad thing to happen to someone who has gone through so much ||| what a freak accident ||| he had the true american dream story ||| yup but going from poor to crazy rich all from hard work. love to see it ||| I wonder if the team retired his number to honor him ||| yes, I watch the yankees almost every night. How about you? ||| yes! they made it to the playoffs! ||| I heard about it in the news when it happened but I don't follow baseball to close just the yankees. I bet he was a pretty big deal on his team. ||| I remember hearing he jumped into the water head first into a rock and it killed him instantly. ||| i couldn't imagine being the family of him that had to be horrible ||| bye ||| how sad is this situation. poor animals ||| right  that government is a mess someone needs to step in ||| me too. I hate seeing them locked in cages doesnt seem right. ||| yea and they brainwash you into thinking theyre helping the animals ||| if you think about it some people do that to cats and dogs when theyre not allowed outside. I wonder if theyre saad too ||| aww but i also feel like having a dog and giving them attention is way better than locking an animal in a cage and never interacting with it ||| true they are very cute and at least in the united states we know they arent starving ||| yea you never really hear where they get the animals from I hope they are all rescued ||| I honestly never had it is always hot and smells kind of gross. How about you? ||| it sounds like a fun experience I went a couple of times when I was young but do not remember it at all. ||| bye ||| its a sad and harsh reality ||| it was very nice for the band to come back and visit the memorial ||| I wish people would stop hurting eachother ||| It's crazy how bad it is everywhere ||| yea i am happy people are trying to prevent this in the united states ||| ah i'm not to educated on this but i am glad there is talks of solutions. ||| I see where your anger is coming from i just feel as though there are good and bad people of every race/ religon and we need to somehow figure out how to find the bad ones ||| what are your thoughts on the school shootings going on in america ||| Very goo point! I believe more people need to be armed ||| Ive heard talks of recession which is scary all we can do is prepare and hope for the best i guess. ||| good idea. I have a lot of food storage and emergency preparedness kits but having live animals would be a good idea. ||| great idea, i cannot even imagine if that happens how people would act but it is good to be armed ||| bye ||| those poor animals. How do you feel about zoos in general? ||| i totally agree. i refuse to go to the zoo. it makes me so sad. ||| wow that is insane. it's sad when a wild animal attacks a person they get put down even though it was the humans fault. ||| aww that breaks my heart! where I live we have a bunch of deer. I love going outside the morning after it snows to see all the deer tracks. It makes me so sad to think that people put down these animals when they really don't do anything wrong. ||| yes, it is so sad. all for entertainment with no care about the animals wellbeing. I do not understand how someone can sleep at night knowing they did that. ||| thankfully there are people in the world like the people who rescued the animals ||| theyre such rare people and it makes me reflect on myself to pay more attention to the world around me. ||| yes it is very easy to forget how big this world is sometimes ||| that reminds me of that racetrack in california that has put down many horses they closed it down to investigate and only 2 days after reopening it they put down another horse. ||| I cannot believe they haven't been permanently shutdown! this is so obvious you'd think action would be taken. ||| the sad reality of rich people doing whatever they want because  the will never face consequences ||| goodbye ||| This article makes sense. Those poor people. ||| yes, i agree. The smog in places like china is disturbing. ||| And then you think about all the wild fires in LA and wonder what those people are breathing in. ||| It also makes you wonder how many people are aware of the air pollution issues where they live and how it is effecting them.] ||| that is a very good point. I wish the government would somehow regulate the air pollution. ||| that is very disturbing. It makes you wonder if population control is a real thing. ||| that is very true. there is different danger everywhere. so many different things could kill us at anytime. it is just better to not think about it. ||| I work from home so I do not drive my car very often. I recycle. I try not to turn my air conditioner on much in the summer. these are small things but if everybody did something i think it would help. ||| I am glad  more people are standing up for the environment. I love seeing celebrities spreading the word. ||| Thats awesome! I enjoy gardening as well. i feel like the food I get from my garden tastes so much better than store bought. ||| you as well bye! ||| She was a remarkable woman. ||| I didn't watch the news much growing up so I had no idea ho she was before reading this. It;s so sad she suffered from parkinsons for 20 years. ||| i cannot even imagine having it. Constantly moving, but I wonder if any medicine can control it some ||| I saw a video online of a lady with dementia and herson took her out to dinner and she didn't recognize him at all. It broke my heart. ||| I'm so sorry! That had to be so scary. I am glad he recognized you. That is a big fear of  mine , forgetting people or having someone you love forget you. ||| That would be awesome. I have high hope they will there's so many smart people in this world. ||| It makes me greatful for everyday I have with my family. Sometimes I forget to be thankfull in the small stresses of life ||| That;s a great way to look at it. Enjoy the times now and try to be happy so when you need to look back at the memories they bring you joy. ||| It stinks that it takes bad things happening for that wake up call ||| Maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss ||| bye ||| I was thinking how you hear about the war but not about the innocent citizens ||| we are lucky that war is not happening in america ||| yes, it is a scary thought that is hard to imagine. Having to flee the country hoping another would accept you. ||| wow that is daunting. especially if you have no communication with you family. the possibilty of never seeing them again is very real ||| that's true. it makes me happy to hear about people who are trying to help ||| I always hear of organazations like doctors without borders who go into dangerous areas to help the citizens. ||| the fact that an entire country encourages people to go back to almost certain death is mind boggling ||| I wonder what is going through their head when they make that decision ||| That is true. Many people who are immigrants in america work and send money back home to support their family. Maybe it's a situation like that. ||| I appreciate how kind you have been! I have really enjoyed this convo! ||| bye! ||| That iis interesting to think about. I wonder who was that careless. It is scary that someone so reactive has that kind of power. ||| this is true. Scary hearing about it  I cannot imagine living there. ||| that is mind boggling and so sad. I remember reading that 16 people were disciplined for this. ||| scary stuff something needs to change. ||| Also, it seems like a crazy idea that they accidentally killed that many people seems odd. ||| imagine if that happened in the united states by another government that would be a big deal. ||| i agree i think at some point we should realize we are doing more harm than good. ||| yes, those poor people have more of a chance of dying with america over there accidentally killing people ||| it has a way of making us grateful that our country is strong but also sad that it does stuff like this ||| this reminds me of a podcast i watched where companies say theyre doing good by for example donating a pair of sneakers to people in africa who are poverty striken. to the outside world this looks great and feels like it is a good deed. But many people in poverty in africa do not wear shoes. they don't need sneakers. they need clean water and seeds to prossper. This is similair to how with war we think killing everyone is going to solve the problem but it won't. it's a facade to look like were doing something good when it is actually not helping at all. ||| yes, it was a joe rogan podcast I believe the one with Kevin hart as a guest. ||| ahh it was a very informative podcast. I highly recommend! None of the political agenda stuff. ||| you as well! bye ||| It so distrubing reading about the death and devastation is allepo ||| Hearing that a little boy was covered in blood and dust is truely heartbreaking ||| Sound like they need some allies to help get rid of the bad guys ||| That is very true it;s hard to find them when they blend in ||| i heard about that. It is insane that nothing is really being done to help the innocent people. ||| wow living there must feel very hopeless. I will never understand how people can be so evil ||| I wish there was a way to help but i think you're right it's such a big problem that is hard to fix ||| it's nice that people on twitter are spreading awareness maybe get the attention of the world if many people talk about it ||| I totally agreethe news likes to make everyone scared of eachother but I think most people want to help others ||| that is very true! ||| you as well bye ||| how sad' ||| she was so close to escaping ||| i never can understandhow it gets that bad ||| i agree and they end upturning to alcohal to numb themselves ||| its scary to think some women have no way to leave ||| yes it is very scary especially since these abusers are narcassists and know how to manipulate ||| i agree ||| totally and awareness of how to leave ||| yea this happens way to often and needs to be addressed ||| So sad ||| Bye ||| yea seems sketchy ||| yes i heard bout another story where they attempted to kill  a father and daughter who were spies ||| they definitely do not do a great job of covering it up ||| wow that is insane! the 3 diffrent causes of death have me puzzled. They are three completely different ways to die and they fumbled over the official cause for a long time which was odd. ||| i do as well. He makes it seem like the people are free but they are not. it's very dangerous. ||| I totally agree it makes you feel so grateful knowing that is not how our country runs. It is little scary knowing it did happen in the usa and america did not take criminal action. ||| I am going to be honest I was afraid to mention trump becausemany people these days get offended but I agree 100 percent with you. Trump makes this country feel so much safer. ||| It feels like the media gets into peoples heads and people believe everything they hear without researching. It seems weird when new that is supposed to be non bias focuses so much on anti trump. It makes me so angry they can fool that many people. ||| it it so sad to see how some people act towards trump especially on twitter. With recent events I have avoided twitter alltogether. ||| they will complain the entire time the economy is doing great and whie they lead successful lives because of trump. People like Bernie Sanders make me so angry they play on poor peoples hot points making false promises they know they can never fulfill. ||| and he can't even fulfill his promises of $15 wages for his employees because he knows how bad of an idea that is. ||| i agree! have you ever watched the joe rogan podcast? ||| I highly recommend he brings a great non biased platform for everyone to speak while also asking the important questions ||| Awesome! I really enjoyed talking politics with you! ||| God bless to you as well! goodbye"
p021,This was pretty troubling to read about the events going on overseas. The families are struggling so much and there's no hope in sight for them to get any relief. Looking over their backs all the time and trying to protect their children. Trying to maintain work available to support their family. I can't imagine what it would be like.,"I felt very disturbed while reading the article about the family situations. ||| It's a hard question.  I feel obligated to return, but it's so dangerous. ||| Right, the whole town needs built again and the entire city is hurting from all the struggling. It would also be so hard to do alone. Would need a team that could agree. ||| Yeah, that's why no one could do it alone. I'd hope there would be a few strong willed individuals that may be able to start something and train others ||| Which will never work. They'll do what they want and have been doing. Basically an army needs created, but they don't have the tools for that. ||| Not that drastic hopefully. Something more of a union maybe, versus army. The few that can defend land or people from Muslims. But I agree, not a major force. ||| I'm not sure. The internet and possibly media may not work beneficially. ||| I can see that. But how is that going to get fixed. It's the elders opinion that would need to change. ||| It's a shame. They are hurting their own people instead of being able to move forward away from this crisis. ||| Granted, that may be true. But that small fraction on both sides is hindering the whole situation. ||| Oh of course. Maybe France could send some ally's back with them to help regrow. ||| There's not exactly much hope there. But if some of the Christians have been able to become close to the French, it may be a start. ||| No, sadly America's own political stragedy prohibits too much outside assistance for that. ||| Some are allowed to come, but not nearly the amount that actually need help and assistance. ||| Agreed completely! America can't do that. I'm not on board with the complete denial. I think petitions are needed to keep the process flowing. ||| goodbye"
p022,"After reading the article, you can't help but feel really sad and terrible for the people that were affected by the hurricane. It was a situation that they did not deserve and one that they most likely did not cause but mother nature has other plans for us. I feel bad for all the children as well as animals that are there as well with no shelter or food. ||| After reading the article, my reaction is that it is very sad that boys that young have to be put behind bars. I think that children should be able to experience their childhood and have fun at that age. They should not be facing hardships at all. They should be playing with friends and be in school at that age and not locked up behind a cell. ||| After reading the article, my first reaction and feeling is that i feel really bad for the brothers. I feel like people their age should not have to be locked inside a jail cell. They should be out in the world improving themselves and being normal people. It's also really sad for the family members of these brothers as well because they are probably all suffering and worrying. ||| After reading the article, i really felt bad for the lady. I felt like she was just trying to get some help for her mental state and people didn't really believe her. I felt like people were just brushing off the fact that she needed help and it was pretty disturbing. I think that society as a whole needs to understand mental health better and how to help people. ||| After reading the article, it's great that the band members still made time to visit the people that were killed during the attack. I also feel that these attacks have been happening way too often now and is now a normal thing. We should be doing more to prevent these attacks from happening and acknowledging the people who died instead of the killers. ||| After reading the article, my initial reaction was that i felt really bad for the polar bears. They did not deserve what is happening to them. It is mainly due to climate change and i believe that is caused mostly by human activities. Because of human greed and consumption, we have to make other living things suffer. Because of this, many animals are facing extinction today. ||| I thought that the article was a bit sad. I feel like being in cars is a serious situation and everyone should be safe. I also think that the parents tried the best that they could to do everything they can in the situation. The sitatuion made me feel a bit sad and a bit concerned as well. It makes me feel like doing something to help them out. ||| I think that the article was very sad and got me worried. The fact that they coudln't find the father and his son is very sad. To think about their family members and the mother as well as what she is currently going through makes me feel awful. The father and son were both probably just trying to bond and having this happen is traumatizing. ||| What happened in the article was very upsetting to read. I felt really bad for the women that got raped. It was also terrible because it stated that many of them were impregnated by these soldiers and there was pretty much nothing they could do about it. It's so damaging not only for the woman but for the unborn child as well. ||| It's really sad what happeend to the people after reading the article. I felt like the people that were living in that area did not deserve what happened to them. They must have been struggling deeply. They probably had no water for a long time and the children there were probably very thirsty. I also think that climate change has a big factor in this. ||| I think what these people are going through is terrible. I think that empathy being taught in school and other places would be a good idea to some extent. I think that people really have to hvae that trait inside them in order for it to work. I think that teaching someone empathy is useless if they don't really believe in it. ||| It's quite sad what happened to the family. I can't even imagine what everyone is going through especially family members. Losing someone to an accident is something you never expect and something that will hurt for a long time. I felt really sad while reading the article because the children were so young and had so much ahead of them. ||| It's pretty sad what Dakota Fanning and her sister had to go through. Going through a divorce with your parents is always hard and never a fun thing. I can't even begin to imagine how Dakota and her sister felt knowing that one of her parents will not always be with them. Things will never be the same as their childhood. ||| I felt like what i read in the article was very disturbing. The things that are going on around the world is very troublesome. It is terrible to know that people are being hung from poles and innocent people are just being killed left and right. It is so inhumane and something i can never even imagine. ||| I think what hapepend in Indonesia is terrible. The haze and fire really damaged lots of people's homes as well as took lives. I can't even imagine to think what it would be like if everything i had was just engulfed in flames and burned. I feel really bad for the families as well as people that have lost a loved one in this. ||| The tragedy that happened in DC was definitely very terrible. Anytime you lose your loved ones or anything to a fire, it can be  very traumatizing. It is also very hard to recover from something like that in my opinion. I think the article said that cats were taken away by the fire. This is tough because i have pets and i love them to death. ||| After reading the article, i felt really bad for the family that was involved in the fire. It is unfortunate because it was something accidental and something that could have happened to anyone. I am also glad that they are okay though and nobody died. I did feel unfortunate and sad for their cats because it stated that they were killed in the fire. ||| What i read in the article about the tourists hurting the polar bears really angers me and makes me sad at the same time. It is terrible that a human being is able to harm an animal and be able to sleep at night. I think that people should be nowhere near polar bears to be honest. They should be left alone where they want to be. ||| After reading this article, my immediate reaction is that it makes me a bit angry. I am angry at the fact that women still have to go by rules like this in today's day and age. It makes me angry that women need the permission of a man in order to be able to do what she wants. In today's world, anyone should be able to do anything and their freedom should not be restricted. ||| After reading the article, i can't help but feel bad for the birds that are eating the plastics. I feel bad for them and i also feel guilty as well because i know that i somehow contributed to that as well because it's not just one person's fault. I feel like it's a collective fault that we should try to fix to try and help out these animals before they go extinct. ||| When you read an article like this, you can't help but feel bad for all the people that died. They were all risking their lives to try and find a better life for their families. They were mainly trying to escape from war and poverty but unfortunate events happened and they never made their way. Hopefully they find a better place in the afterlife. It's very unfortunate what happened to them. ||| My overall reaction is that i felt really bad for the people in that country. They are nothing but innocent civilians but they have to be the ones that suffer the wrath of war and issues in the government. it's terrifying to not know where your home is and sleep whereever you can. These people are basically just wandering around hoping they can find a safe place. ||| After reading the article, you really can't help but feel bad for all the people that are required to leave the area. It feels as though there is always war and people will never feel safe. They always are on the lookout and can never live a stable and happy life like others do. I feel really bad for them and i hope that their future is better than it is now. ||| After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for all the Muslims that are currently living in America. You feel bad for them because of what they are going through and all the discrimination they are facing. It's unfair that the ones that are innocent are being stereotyped as well and lumped into the same group as the terrorists when not everyone is like that. ||| After reading this article, i felt really disturbed. I just couldn't believe that there is someone out there that can kill his own children. I wonder what kind of mental illness the man had because nobody in their right mind can just kill their own children. I felt really bad for the mother as well who is left alone iwth nobody now and can only suffer. ||| After reading the article, i can't help but feel bad for the people and children in the camps. I feel bad for them because nobody should have to be living in those type of conditions. Everyone should be able to have shelter, food, and a nice place to sleep on. I feel like these people are almost being treated like dirt and it's very unfair. ||| After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for these people. We're so far into humanity and we are still seeing people suffer from hunger and thirst. We should not be having these problems today. I think that the world should try to do more to take notice of these situations and try to help out whenever possible because we all have that right. ||| After reading the article, i felt really bad for the wolf and animals that get hunted in general. I think that there should definitely be some sort of punishment for people who decide to kill animals, especially endangered species of animals just for fun. I think it is so inhumane and twisted that someone can kill a beautiful animal like that with no type of remorse whatsoever. ||| After reading something like that, you can't help but feel extremely sad. You feel sad for the wolf and you also feel angry that humans would do such a thing. It's terrible that humans just kill and use animals as they wish. I think that animals have all the right in the world to live as well and we can't just use them as we please.  ||| After reading the article, i just feel so bad for the people that are in the war as much as the people that were affected and killed in this war. I feel like war overall is just terrible and we should do all we can to try and stop it. All it induces is hate and death. The people are that are the war has family at home and they can do nothing but grieve and worry abotu them. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel disappointed in people and humanity. I feel bad because i read that the people in the community were killing police officers. It's terrible that police have to be viewed as a bad thing in society today when police were the ones we use to run to for help. I hope things turn out for the better for the country in the future. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel really disgusted and disturbed by what i read. The fact that someone can harm or sexually assault their own child is downright terrible. People like this need to be locked up for ever or even suffer the death penalty. It's terrible because they gave birth to this girl but now her life is already ruined. ||| After reading the article, you can't help but feel sorry for the people that were affected by the fire. It's a good thing that most only had minor injuries and there weren't any deaths though. I think that something like this is terrible because it is an accident of one person that can really hurt others as well. Hopefully people are more careful in the future. ||| I feel really bad for the miners that were trapped. It was an unfortunate situation and an accident that was hard to avoid. It was just a freak accident and i would not wish this upon anybody. Those people must have been so scared inside that cave. The families of the ones that were lost are all suffering as well which makes me very sad. ||| After reading the article, i felt really bad for the victims that were sexually abused. It really disgusts me that there are men out there that can so easily take advantage of others just for a couple seconds of pleasure. I think that people like this should be put behind bars and kept away from society for ever. This person violated multiple women. ||| I feel so bad for these children after reading the article. It was not their fault at all but rather the fault of the parents who just leave pills laying around everywhere. The parents should be more responsible for their actions knowing that there are children running around. They should be double checking the floors to make sure they didn't drop anything. ||| I think it's terrible that children are dying because of silly mistakes of parents. The fact that parents can drop something so dangerous like a drug on the ground shows that these parents shouldn't have children in the first place. I think that drugs like these should always be out of reach for children and parents should always check to see if they've dropped anything. ||| After reading the article, i felt so bad for the poor flamingo. It was just minding it's own business when the man attacked it and slammed it to the ground. This makes me lose hope for humanity because someone can actually do something like this is terrible. This person should be put in jail or at least fined because of what he has done. ||| After reading the article, i felt really alarmed and worried about wildlife heading into the future. I think that more and more species of animals will start to die out and go extinct because of lack of water as well as food. Hopefully the future generation could figure something out to combat this because if it continues down this path, Earth will end. ||| I think that after reading this article, i definitely felt a bit of disgust. I would definitely try and look out for myself more often after hearing about these diseases. The fact that there are so many squirrels running around everywhere makes me feel nervous. Also the fact that they can attack you at anytime makes me extremely nervous as well. ||| It's so sad that innocent civilians need to die because of war and fighting. These people did nothing wrong and were just minding their own business before their lives were taken away. It's not fair for the people and it's not fair for the families of the people that were killed as well. They are left without a family member and they have to live with that forever. ||| After reading the article, i just feel really disturbed about it. The fact that someone can harm an animal is just mind boggling to me. I feel like people like this really need to be put behind bars. If they are willing to harm an animal, who knows what else they might do to humans. I feel like this is only the beginning for these people and they will do much worse. ||| After reading the article, it just makes me so sad that there are soldier that are still being killed. It's great that they are willing to sacrifice their own lives for their country but it's still sad. They have family that they are leaving behind and they will have to suffer for the rest of their lives. It's very sad to know that we are still in war after so long. ||| After reading this article, i feel that i can definitely relate to it . I defintely am guilty of sometimes wasting food even when it's still fresh. There are times when i buy a really large meal and just leave it in the fridge until it's expired. So reading this article, it made me feel very guilty and uneasy because of how close it hits. ||| After reading this article, i couldn't help but wonder if it is telling the truth of not. I thought that you would never really know if it was accidental or not because the government could just be hiding the truth from everyone. They are not as democratic as the United States so i am sure they hide things fro mtheir people. ||| After reading the article, the only feelings i can say that i have is one of sadness. It's terrible that these people had this unfortunate hurricane hit them. There was nothing they could have really done and they definiteyl did not deserve this. The fact that there are little children with no food or water really hurts me. There are most likely animals out there that are in need of food and water as well. ||| After reading the article, my initial and first reaction is that i felt really bad for the player. There are things like accidents that we can't control and the fact that it happened to this person is very unfortunate. I feel really bad for the person and for the family of the player as well. I really hope he can make a full recovery and is able to find something he really enjoys. ||| After reading the article, i just feel really bad for people that have been in war, especially veterans. The stuff that they saw in war was already bad enough but they still have to suffer once they are out of war as well. I can only imagine the toll is has on them mentally as well as physically. Their suffering probably brings suffering to their families as well. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel really sad for the animals that are in the zoo. They deserve better than this. Thinking about zoos make me feel disgusted in general because animals are being locked up just for our viewing pleasures. I think that in the future, zoos should be made illegal because the animals should be out in the wild and roaming free. ||| After reading the article, i just felt really sad for the woman. She probably trained really hard and was really excited to get to this point just for it to be taken away. It was an accident so there was really nothing that could have prevented it. It was just bad luck in my opinion and just a really sad tragic event. I really hope her family is fine. ||| I thought what i read in the article was very sad. It's sad that teens and young children are killing themselves because they feel like they have the weight of the world on their shoulders. It's especially sad when these children are so young and taking their lives so early when they have the whole world ahead of them. ||| I definitely think that something needs to be done about these airstrikes. Too many people are losing their lives and too many people are dying. It's not even just the people that are in the war but people that are innocent are affected as well. This goes for children and little babies. These people have done nothing and are getting killed. ||| I think these earthquakes that have been happening are terrible. They seem to be so common now and so many lives are being taken because of this. If their lives aren't taken, they probably lost their homes or belongings somehow. This makes it hard for many people to pick themselves back up and continue living. I think that they should definitely try and get some sort of help from the government. ||| As sad as i feel for Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie, it doesn't really bother me too much. The main reason being that they are already filthy rich. I do feel bad for the children though. Not really knowing who your father is and being taken care of by only a single mother can be very tough. You wouldn't know where to go to for help or advice. ||| After reading the article, my first reaction was anger. I just couldn't believe that any man would be able to take the lives of his own children. It felt really wrong and that man is very messed up in the head. I was also starting to think that maybe the man just had some sort of mental illness that was very severe. The man could also have been under the influence of drugs. ||| After reading the article , my first reaction was that i was really disturbed by what i read. I just couldn't believe that anyone would be able to kill their own children. It also made me feel really bad for the mother because i can't even imagine what i would do if this were to happen to my family. I felt bad for the children as we ll because they didn't deserve it. ||| I think that what happened with the dog was so sad and terrible. I honestly don't think that the police officer did that on purpose but rather it was just a terrible accident. It was stated that the dog has been working with the police officer for quite some time so i'm sure that they had some sort of bond. It's just really sad that such an innocent animal died because of this accident. ||| I think it's terrible that this man had to get deported. I feel like if you lived in United States for a certain amount of time, you are officially a member of the country no matter what. It is so depressing and sad that this man had to be separated from his family and have everything that was his taken away. It is unfair and i think the system is broken as well. ||| What happened in this article was truly disturbing. The fact that someone can have the decency to not only kill someone but to also burn them as well is very inhumane. I felt really disgusted and just lost all faith in humanity after reading this article. It makes me question people and wonder if there is actually any good left in the world. ||| After reading the article, i can't help but feel terrible and disturbed. I feel bad because i just can't imagine how people could do something like this to another human being. It's terrible because people were just trying to have fun at the party while these other people had other intentions like steal. I hope they get what they deserve in the long run. ||| I feel that this article is really disturbing because i feel so bad for the elephant. I feel that elephant are such gentle animals and people just take advantage of that. Elephants are one of the sweetest animals in the world and wouldn't hurt a fly. The fact that people are using elephants for entertainment and just taking them away from their families is really disturbing. ||| I feel really bad for the girl that lost her eyes due to the attack with the pellets. She had her whole life ahead of her and she did not deserve what happened to her. She was merely a victim to all the war and corruption that is going on in the country. It's sad to think that someone who once had vision and is now never able to see anything ever again. ||| I think that after reading the article, it just confirms my views on war and terrorism. It has been going on for way too long and it really needs to come to an end. Innocent people are dying as well as getting killed. Families of these people are all grieving that they just lost a family member. Overall, it's terrible that this is still going on in the world today and there's nothing we can do about it. ||| This is a very disturbing article and i really hope that the girl grows up to be a decent person. What she had to go through was nothing that a child should ever have to go through. It was terrible and disturbing to say the least. Those two parents should be put in jail for their whole life or even the death sentence. The fact that thye can do this to a minor, let alone their own daughter, is so bad. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel really disturbed. It's so disturbing that someone can do that to their own child. The fact that you are doing this to a child is already bad enough but to do it to your own child is downright disgusting. These people deserve the life sentence in my opinion. If you are able to do something like this, who knows what else you are capable of. ||| I feel really bad for the people that were involved in this accident. It was so terrible and so many lives were lost because of something so unexpected happening. It really makes me feel bad for the families of the ones that were lost as well. All of their lives will be impacted by this and will make living on much more harder. ||| After reading the article, you just can't help but feel really sad for the boy and his family. It's so sad because he was just doing his family a favor by harvesting crops when he fell. It's so unfortunate as well because he was so young and he had his whole life ahead of him. Hopefully his parents are able to move on with life peacefully. ||| After reading the article, i feel so bad for all the wildlife and fishes that are in the body of water that were affected by the spill. We are already harming the earth and it's inhabitants already by polluting the air but this just adds on to it. I really hope we can come to a day where we will be able to help animals instead of harming them. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel disturbed at the fact that humans can do things like this to animals. Humans should be more aware of what they are doing and the fact that they can harm animals unintentionally. Humans should do more to help other living things on Earth because we are not the only things living here. ||| After reading the article, my heart just breaks for all the wildlife that was affected. I believe it is mostly human fault that this is happening in the first place. The animals as well as wildlife needs to affected because of the bad decisions we make. It is terrible and i feel like it's time for humans to make a change to really help other living things. ||| I think that this whole war situation just needs to stop. People are dying left and right. There are innocent bystanders that are getting killed as well because of the actions of others. It is not fair and it is not right that innocent people need to be killed. It is also sad for the fmailies of these American soldiers as well having to see this news. ||| After reading the article, my heart just breaks for the people that are affected by this. Not only are innocent people being killed daily but also little children as well as babies. These children do not deserve this and it's sad because they have their whole lives ahead of them. I really hope that war will end one day although it is looking unlikely. ||| After reading the article, it's easy to  understand the anger and confusion for the Jewish people towards electing Trump as president. They are still thinking about their history and what happened to them back then. It's easy to understand why they don't believe in some of the same principals as others. I think Jewish people still need to be helped in the future. ||| After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for the people that were involved in the train crash. IT was a freak accident and something you can't control. It 's just sad because they had to leave all of their family behind and their lives will most likely never be the same. While reading it, i felt really worried because it could happen to anyone. ||| After reading the article,  i couldn't help but feel a bit nervous about the whole situation. I find that it's terrible that people are okay with shooting police now. I feel like people should see the police as more of help instead of the enemies. I also feel bad for police because they are just doing their jobs but they are getting killed for it. ||| After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel really disturbed. I can't believe that anyone can kill their whole family like that including their own dog. I feel that people like that are really messed up in the head. If you are willing to kill yourself, you should probably leave your family alone because killing them really does nothing. It's very and disturbing.","It's terrible. Not only the people but the animals as well! ||| I really wish there was something i could do. ||| I agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane? ||| Yes! It's actually terrifying. We were supposed to evacuate but decided to stay because we thought , what's the worst that can happen? ||| Thank you! I'm glad that we still had water and electricity. I can't even imagine what the people over in Haiti are going through ||| Yeah, it's going to be tough but i am sure she is strong enough to raise them. ||| True. Have you been in ANY kind of natural disasters? ||| Never been in one but i can only imagine it's even scarier than a hurricane ||| Agree. I hope those people get some water and food as soon as possible ||| Yup! Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| Please, what did you think about the article ||| It's terrible. I feel bad for all the people left without shelter! ||| Agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane? ||| Wow, Haiti sounds awesome. I'm from Florida so there's lots of them here and they are all nice. ||| It's pretty stressful when hurricanes hit. I once stayed for one even though we were supposed to evacuate, nobody was hurt but it was a scary experience ||| It's scary because all you can do is hide in your home hoping it passes by without doing much damage. I hope the people affected by the hurricane are getting help right now. ||| Yeah it's definitely very different. The air pressure feels different when you're in a hurricane. All you hear are sounds of things ripping apart ourside ||| Atlantic, i've lived in Florida for about 8 years now and luckyily haven't had any MAJOR hurricane yet. ||| I didn't think of that. That's why i don't even donate but i feel bad because i can't help ||| Sad that people are so corrupt. I really hope those people get help. It was nice talking to you! bye! ||| Hey there. I am not but i do feel really sorry for the player! You? ||| I feel bad not only for him but his family as well ||| Yeah accidents happen and you just never know what will happen. :( ||| Yup, i try to live by the motto live everyday like it's your last but it's not easy to follow ||| I totally agree. If you don't mind me asking , why are you hoping time speeds up? ||| Oh wow, congrats to you! ||| I can't even imagine! But back to the sotry, i hope the family is fine now. ||| True. I heard of KINDA a similar incident with a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. It's all so terrible ||| For sure! It's very heartbreaking. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the articlee? ||| Definitely. I felt so bad for the children at first. ||| They should be in school and making friends! ||| I had a cousin who went to jail at a young age, he never really changed. ||| I definitely believe that people can't really change. what about you? ||| Maybe my cousin is just a sociopath. I hope those kids that got out find good jobs in the future. ||| I think that if i owned a business, i would definitely think twice about a person who served time ||| How would you feel about someone in your family marrying a person that went to jail before? ||| What if it's minor like stealing, but has done it many times. ||| Very interesting! Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| It's terrible! I feel so bad for the kid because he should be in school. ||| He probably was terrified and is going to be scarred for life now.. ||| Do you think jail can really change the kid for the better? ||| I agree. I have a cousin that went to jail before for stealing and he's the same. ||| Pretty much. He just hasn't improved for the better and jail didn't really help him ||| The kid should be out making friends and playing video games.. not rotting in jail ||| Hopefully he finds a girl he can marry that cares about him because his family doesnt ||| It just makes you wonder how many other children are out there being put in cells.. ||| Agreed. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article? ||| I agree. I feel like we are not doing enough about mental illness as a society ||| Exactly! It's very rare you find a good therapist. Most of them just can't wait to get home. ||| It must have been really tough for you. I think i have mild depression and it's such a struggle. ||| Yeah it's terrible. I have anxiety as well and everyday is a struggle to be honest ||| I am the same. I even have trouble going out with close friends sometimes. Just being around people, i don't like.. ||| Yeah i still feel bad for the person in the article. Do you think people in society now are more accepting of mental illnesses? ||| That's an interesting way to look at it but i agree. I honestly don't think society will EVER be accepting of people with mental illnesses. They'll always think of us as the \crazy\"" ones."" ||| Well at least we all know deep down we're great people and just slightly different which makes us special. ||| I get those feelings as well but i think we should tell ourselves that it's okay to have these feelings from time to time. But anyway, that's it for our convo, hope you have a great life and things improve! bye ||| yes such disrespect should be frown at ||| Yes these people absolutely give their all to the country ||| I think there should be a facility made to help these veteran battling with this ||| I will definitely support that ||| Well need collective effort of the citizen to make sure this is done ||| And more veteran battling with this will be able to come out and seek out help as well ||| We really need to be warm to them honestly ||| We need to lay good foundation for generations coming as regards this ||| Doing this will increase the morale of people who are willing to serve the country more ||| No doubt about that ||| It's very sad. These animals definitely do not deserve this. ||| Yeah! I mean even zoos in the US, i feel bad for the animals. ||| It's just weird to think about. People take these animals away, put them in cages, just so they can make money. ||| Exactly. How often do you see a lion exhibit with just 1 lion. What do you think it does all day? It's so sad. ||| Definitely. I am actually guilty of that. I have 1 dog whom i never walked outside because we lived in a tiny apartment. Now she has issues as she gets older, terrible anxiety. ||| Yeah that is true. I think zoos are terrible but if we never had zoos, it'd be really hard to see most of these animals ||| I guess that's true. You feel bad for these animals too because they're taken away from their familes. ( or maybe they're just rescues) ||| Do you enjoy going to the zoo? ||| It is very fun!  I would recommend going just to see all the animals up close ||| Interesting, definitely give it another go! Well it was nice talking to you, bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article? ||| I honestly don't know. I would say ban guns but poeple will just find other ways. ||| OR even making things like bombs, or just running people over with cars. ||| I think people will always find ways to kill.. no matter what you do. Doesn't matter what you ban ||| It's terrible. I feel like they should be put away ||| I think if someone were to commit mass murder, death is the only punishment. You? ||| I just feel like if you are able to take the lives of 50+ people, you honestly don't deserve a second chance\\ ||| Hello what did you think about the articel? ||| It's so sad because we're just doing more harm instead of helping ||| Oh wow, how do they explain things that are happening like in the article? ||| I never asked my parents but i'm sure they think the same to be honest ||| Yup! This is why i think we need a younger presidential candidate in office for the next election. Smeone who will be able to understand things like climate change and not live in the old ways. ||| I recently saw it. I understand and side with her but i felt it was a bit aggressive ||| Yeah but it also gives me hope for the next generation as well! ||| So would you say you are doing anything to help the climate ||| That's good. I definitely need to start doing more because i am still in the mindset that what i do won't make much of a difference since i'm only one person ||| Yup. Let's hope the future gets better for everyone.. and everything. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| I felt really sad for the woman and her family. What about you? ||| It sucks that she trained all this time to be a pilot jsut to get killed. ||| Might be just something with the jets, it was just very unfortunate ||| She seemed very young from the article, seemed like she just became a pilot not long ago. Overall, being on a plane is scary, for me at least. Just being in the air in general is scary. ||| Yeah! I honestly get nervous just flying on an airplane. ||| I was on one time and the plane dropped for like 2 seconds before regaining balance. The pilot apologized but everyone was s cared outta their minds ||| Yup! Agreed. Hopefully teh family of the woman are all fine now. It must be really hard losing a family member like that. ||| I can't even imagine training all your life for this and then just having it taken away. ||| Nope, reminds me of a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. You never know what's going to happen. ||| Yup, gotta live everyday like it's your last! (or at least try to). Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| I felt like the article was a bit worriesome. What abotu you? ||| I guess that's what i meant too. It worries me to think about what the remaininig family members have to go through. ||| I know someone who went through the same thing, their family was never the same. It's very sad. ||| Wow, i feel bad for them. To lose someone you love unexpectedly, i can't even imagine. ||| How long do you think it'll take for the family members to recover? or at least, not feel as much pain as they're feeling now ||| I think it'll take at least half a year before the feeling of shock leaves. But like you said, they'll prob never recover. Or at least never be the same. ||| That's why i always preach live life to it's fullest and show love to everyone. You never know what will happen. ||| Same here. I don't do things like skiing or snowboarding even though all my friends love that. ||| Definitely. I  undertand how my parents feel now when i was younger and did reckless things. ||| Well, it was nice talking to you. I hope that family recovers. :( ||| bye ||| The article was very sad. What did you think abotu it? ||| Did they find the bodies yet? I thought i read that they are still looking. Either way, i'm pretty sure both passed away. ||| I wonder what the mom is going through. It's terrible. ||| i think it's pretty bad. Or at least for the father. I'm sure he would have wanted his son to live and grow up to watch his mom ||| Yeah you're right. There weren't much details about what happened. Though, i do hope they find their bones(assuming they passed away) ||| Yeah, i try to stay away from things like hiking. lol ||| I'm so sorry to hear that. That's why i always preach live life to the fullest and show love to your loved ones ||| Also living life to the fullest, never know what will happen. ||| That's true. Either way, it's scary to think about. What do you think happened though? Do you think they're both dead? ||| A rockslide sounds about right. Are they sure they fell? What if they got eaten by an animal. ||| Let's just hope something positive comes out of this although i doubt it. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| It is very sad. I have some young cousins so it gets me worried. ||| I would say because they are very introverted. Spend lots of time indoors and don't like socializing with others. ||| I would think it's because of bullying at school to be honest. I think that's what causes most suicides ||| I honestly think so as well. I think social media forces children and teens to think they have to be a certain way. ||| Definitely. As well as anxiety if it gets too serious i would say. ||| You got that right. I wonder if there will ever be some type of ban or limit on social media in the future. ||| Do you know anyone that has been through this situation or osmething similar? ||| No but i do have a friend that is always depressed and that can lead to something else in the future ||| Active like browsing other people. Not posting or anything though ||| Thats a great idea, definitely would help. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| I would say a limit on social media like Instagarm. maybe it can close after a certain amount of minutes. It will prob never happen though, but just an idea. ||| Sounds good. Hope things will improve in the future. bye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| I agree. Just thinking about the women who got impregnated by these terrible soldiers makes me sad. ||| I wonder how those children grew up. It's a terrible situation for the moms as well as the children that were born ||| Just imagine what the fathers are going through.... man. ||| Yeah. I'm so glad we don't have any of these issues in modern times ||| I guess i meant to say here in America. I wonder if there's anything people can do to help this situation ||| Great. These crazy groups need to all disappear lol ||| Agreed. I think majority are wiped out though. Let's hope for a better future. ||| Do you think USA should meddle in foreign affairs though? ||| I can agree with that. We definitely have issues here that are more important. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| So what did you think about the people and their situation with the water? ||| It's messed up. So you mainly think the company should pay for all the damages? ||| True. I don't remember if i read it, but i hope there weren't any casualties in this situation. ||| Definitely. I'm sure that affects the whole ecosystem as well. Sort of reminds me of Flint ||| It's still messed up from what i've seen on television and articles that i've read. :( ||| Hm i have no knowledge of that at all but yeah, i hope noone got sick or died from that. ||| Do you think you would ever donate to a cause like that to help the people? ||| Agreed. I'm pretty sure people and celebrities have donated a ton to Flint but yet, they're still in the same position. ||| I'll be thinking about that before i go to sleep tonight lol. Nice talking to you! ||| Oh sorry about that. I counted the code as a line. Do you think it has anything to do with the climate changing causing the mud slide ||| Yeah, it's a terrible situation overall. Freak accident.. kinda ||| Yup. Fingers crossed! ||| okay. It was nice talking to you! Hope you didn't think i was trying to leave early because i didn't want to talk to you lol ||| bye ! ||| I think it's terrible that it's killing so many people. ||| It sucks because there are so many innocent people getting killed. ||| What do you think we can do about it? ||| I think it's just relations. I mean, what do you think we can do to stop the killing of the air airdrops on innocent ppls ||| But how can you, it's a bomb ||| There should be, but what is the way? ||| Who is the expert? ||| That makes sense. ||| Do you feel bad for the families? It's terrible ||| I hope they get some type of help in the form of money. ||| bye ||| tell me about it! There was one recently in California as well. ||| yea. I don't think anyone died so that's a good thing! ||| True. I can't even imagine how a town like that would start to rebuild. ||| Definitely. I am so glad i dont live in a state with earthquakes! ||| Haha. Do you have any family in states with earthquakes? ||| My friend lives over there. He said the earthquake lasted 40 seconds at least! ||| Oh yeah, i always thought they lasted 3-5 seconds. Boy was i wrong ||| I wish there was some way we could help those families affected by the earthquake. :( ||| That's true. Those charities can be very shady. ||| Yeah, if i lived where the families were affected, i'd rather spend time volunteering somehow ||| Same! Well It was nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| I agree it's terrible. Do you think you can really teach empathy though? ||| I agree. I think it doesn't matter how much you teach someone empathy, if they were born with no empathy.. i'm not sure if these classes will change them. ||| I agree. What do you think about allowing some of thse people in the US? ||| It's pretty sad watching the news and seeing all these families being separated. :( ||| Yeah, the conditions they're keeping these children in when detained.. terrible ||| Seriously, we have no right to treat others that way. These people are still human at the end of the day. ||| Let's hope the future changes for the better. So you do think that we should have a class that specifically teaches empathy? ||| That's a good idea. Nothing wrong with putting the good out there. ||| I wonder if there's anyway we can help these immigrants ||| Let's hope our next president looks more into this issue. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| I feel so bad for him. I can't even imagine what he's going through. ||| I wish there was a way i could help him. It's terrible. I lost a friend to an accident once.. but to lose your family is crazy. ||| Do you think self driving cars will be able to prevent more accidents? ||| Agreed. Man, those kids in the accident had so much ahead of them. ||| I don't remember but what happened to the person that caused the accident? ||| I can see that. I wouldn't be able to live knowing what i did.. even if it was an accident ||| I thought we needed 10? We're only at  7 each ||| Anything else you want to add about the article? ||| Probably a psychologist? He's definitely going to have some sort of mental issue ||| bye ||| It was terrible. I felt a bit bad for him but not really because he's rich. ||| That's true. Are you a fan of Billy BOb Thornton or Angelina Jolie? ||| NO but i have seen Angelina Jolie's movies. ||| Do you think Angelina Jolie deserves to keep the children? ||| Do you know any single mothers or parents in general? ||| I'm not a parent yet. Since you're a parent, how would you feel if you were a single parent? ||| That's true. It's just tough for children to grow up with 1 parent in my opinion. ||| That's good. Your mom's a superhero. ||| I don't think it's necessary to be honest. You do this big wedding and now you say you're married. Ok now what? It's the smae as being bf/gf. ||| I'm still not married yet at the age of 32. Am i too old? ||| That's true. IT was nice talking to you. bye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the situation with the divorce? ||| I think the same although i do feel bad for Dakota and Elle ||| Actors. I believe Elle Fanning played Cinderella? Or one of the Disney movies. ||| Yup. Married for many years and still together so i don't know what they're going through. I'm sure it's tough. What about you? ||| I am sorry to hear that. Were you old enough to really understand and realize what happened with your parents? ||| Ah, so sorry you had to go through all of that. Didn't mean to bring those thoughts back in your head. ||| Definitely. There's no point in staying together if you're going to fight and argue, especially in front of your children. ||| I wonder how Dakota and Elle Fanning are doing now. I don't remember if the article stated how old they were when their parents divorced. ||| That's good to know.  But yeah to sum it all up for me, it's a sad situation but like you said.. as long as everyone is happy. ||| It was nice talking to you! Thanks for sharing your story as well. bye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| It's insane. I thought we were close to getting rid of ISIS.. i guess not. ||| That's true. To think of all the innocent children being killed is saddening. ||| Yea, guaranteed they will be traumatized. I think i read they were putting people on poles? That's disgusting. ||| My god, that's horrifying. I feel bad for all the soldiers that had to serve there as well. It's equally as traumatizing for them. ||| Yeah that's really tough. It's sad because i don't think ISIS is going anywhere anytime soon. I'm expecting more deaths to come which is crazy to think about. ||| Let's hope none of that ever makes it way towards the US. That we're free from war. ||| It would definitely be an all out battlefield. Do you think there is anything that people can do to help the situation? ||| What do they do with babies there? Hope they're not killed as well.. actually i don't know if i even want to know. ||| I think we will leave it at that. It was nice talking to you! ||| bye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the haze and fires? ||| Wow, i must have read wrong because i 100,000 is a lot of people! I have family in Indonesia too ||| Nope, i never even heard about it so it must have been in another part. It's scary to think about though. ||| I'm not sure but i have never heard of it. Oh yeah, there were those crazy fires just a couple months ago i think ||| That's true lol i've only been to Cali once. I heard it's terrible though. It's scarier than something like a hurricane because you can't really hide in your house. ||| Wow, they got lucky. It's scary to think that any day... your house could get burned. It's never guaranteed to be safe ||| Hmm, good tip. I'll keep that in mind! So you're from the east, you get hurricanes or tornados? ||| Lucky! Yeah natural disasters are no fun. I've been through a hurricane. We were supposed to evacuate but my family decided to stay. Nothing major happened but it was scary seeing trees and fences get ripped apart through your windows. ||| Nope no basement. Only boarded up windows and doors. ||| Yup. Interesting fact, houses in FL don't have basements because of the hurricanes and flooding. Also, it was nice talking to you! bye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the fire and what happened? ||| I agree. Do you own any pets? ||| I have two dogs. Love them to death so i can't even imagine what those people are going through. ||| One is a Lab and the other is a Maltese ||| Golden retrievers are really smart. So have you been through, or know anyone, that has been in a fire before ||| Nope, thank goodness. So what do you think that family that was in the fire should do now? They lost everything, it's terrible. ||| It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad. ||| Just the fact that the pets were trapped inside. I'm sure they'll look into a doggy door or something next time around. ||| Me too. Did it mention what kind of pets they werE? ||| I don't think so. The article was pretty brief and vague ||| True. Well it was nice talking to you. bye! ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| Yeah i think it said they lost both cats. It's a sad and tragic situation ||| I hope the family didn't get burned or hurt in any way ||| That's good! Wonder how they're doing now after what happened ||| Yeah! It must have been traumatizing and something that would stay with them forever ||| Not only that but they probably lost all their favorite toys as well, sigh. ||| Have you ever been burned? Even one small burn hurts like heck ||| Ouch! I got burned because my brother put a hot pan on my arm when we were younger ||| It was on purpose but we were just children so it happens i guess ||| Nope. Thank God and i really hope something like that never happens to anyone! Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| What do you think about the situation with the polar bears? ||| It's terrible though. Did the article mention what the tourists did to the polar bears? ||| It was a pretty short article so i'm not sure. Either way, poor polar bears. :( ||| How can we help the polar bears? :( ||| Maybe the tourists are stealing all of the polar bear's food. ||| oh no that's terrible! It's not the bear's fault ||| Probably no way. I just feel bad for them. Imagine killing a mother polar bear.. what's going to happen to the babies?! It's all so sad. ||| I don't even hold back my tears. I just bawl because it's so sad. I remember seeing a video where a hawk ate one of the babies. ||| That's true. I definitely don't do all that i can to help the environment ||| really? one person can make an impact? ||| I will definitely try to do more in the future. Well it was nice talking to you my friend. bye! ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| It's terrible. Imagine having to ask your partner for permission to do anything ||| That is crazy! You would have to kill me before i ask my son for permission to do something! ||| Probably. Imagine asking a 10 year old for permission to do something. Doesn't seem real.. ||| Yeah, it's going to take MANY years of remolding their brains and seeing things from different perspectives until there is actual change ||| That's true. We should be very fortunate because we have freedom to do what we want.. kinda ||| That's great to hear. Would you ever date a partner that is controlling? ||| That's an interesting take. I don't think i would ever be able to! ||| I hope the women in Saudi Arabia are able to find freedom within the next 10 years, i feel they have bene suffering for a long time ||| Nice chatting with you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| What does \t\"" mean? I thought the article was sad what is happening to the birds."" ||| Oh it's okay! It's very sad.  I think humans should take more responsibility ||| I've never thought of it like that but yeah , it sucks! I'm definitely guilty of harming the environment at times ||| I hope the next generation understands climate change more and makes a difference! ||| That's interesting! I don't think i've ever even heard of the word climate change back when i was in school. ||| I'm not sure what can be done to fix that though unfortunately, people will continue to be...people ||| Yup, although some countries like China are heading towards the \green\"" direction. I believe they're trying their best to eliminate plastics"" ||| True, they really have no choice lol ||| Hopefully this problem will be fixed in the future! It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| Yeah it's so bad because they just wanted a better life ||| I agree. They were all so excited to go somewhere new but ended up dying ||| I agree, maybe give them more food and water ||| That's a good idea. I wonder if USA will help ||| I feel bad for the families that are still alive but lost a member ||| Yeah i would just cry all day and go into depression. It's good these people are trying to have a better life though ||| Let's hope their famlies are able to live better lives. ||| Yeah and the children get education ||| That's a good way to think about it! Well it was nice talking to you, bye ||| Hello what did you think of the article ||| It's so bad because these people are pretty much just wanderers. ||| I agree. We should let other countries handle their own business ||| Wow, that's so sad. We think of our country as so great but others think of us as villains. ||| It's just all very corrupt. I wish war would just end. ||| That's true. I just feel bad for all the innocent children being affected by this ||| They still had their whole lives ahead of them. Would you accept them in our country illegally? ||| I agree, let's leave helping others up to China ||| do you know anyone i nwar? ||| I can't even imagine. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| It's terrible what they have to go through on a daily basis ||| Me neither. Imagine always having to run away from something.. even when you did nothing wrong ||| Yeah that's true just not to that extent. wish there was something we could do to help ||| I feel very fortunate after reading that article ||| True, we have our own issues but at least our lives aren't at stake. Well except for shootings ||| Yeah everyone's too busy with their lives to really dig into all of this! ||| I guess i can be guilty of this at times but there is nothing you can really do. Just emphatize and move on ||| Yup i agree. Do you think the future will be better for those people in that country? ||| Yeah, let's pray for them! It was nice talking to you! bye ||| hello what did you think about the article ||| It's terrible. They are getting so stereotyped ||| I don't think anything can be done. We just have to wait because i think children growing up now are more open and understanding to others ||| I agree. Have you ever experienced anything like that? discrimination? ||| I have never fortunately. I would be very angry though if it were to happen ||| That is very true and mature of you. What do you think of Muslim people? ||| No bad experienced here either. I definitely wouuldn't be scared or anything though if i saw one ||| Definitely. I feel like that's the same thing for any race ||| Hopefully Muslims have a better future ||| it was nice talking to you! bye ||| I felt sad but at the same time angry at the man. What about you? ||| It's terrible too because how can you kill your own children?! ||| Yeah, exactly! I don't think the article mentioned it but i wonder what was the purpose ||| Oh no i mean what the purpose of killing his sons were. I do agree though that he shouldn't have a gun! ||| I just wouldn't understand the thought of killing your own children as well. Of course, i will never be able to understand but still! It feel bad for the mother... wonder what happened with her ||| Yeah.. do you think that people with severe mental illness should be allowed to have children?? ||| Yeah, that can be a tough question. Do you know anyone with depression or suicidal thoughts? ||| That's good to know! Glad you're doing better! Did you do anything to improve these thoughts? ||| I have a bit of depression of anxiety myself but i never thought to go to therapy because i felt like it's just like talking to a friend ||| That's true. Well it was nice chatting with ya! bye! ||| hello what did you think about the article ||| Yeah they didn't give a reason. I'm guessing it's because of mental issues ||| I just find it so disturbing how someone can kill their own children. ||| I think it said he killed himself as well as his two sons ||| Maybe he had schizophrenia, a voice in his head just telling him to do it ||| I wonder what happened to the mom... i would probalby want to kill myself after knowing what happened ||| Poor lady. Some people should not be allowed to own guns ||| True. Do you think people with mentall illnesses should be allowed to have children ||| I would say no. They can't even take care of themselves. ||| True. Well it was nice talking to you! bye! ||| I felt like it was very disturbing and sad. What about you? ||| Maybe he was suffering from some sort of mental illness ||| Yeah, everyone thinks of men with depression as \weak\"" which is sad."" ||| Yeah. I don't think people with mental illness should have a gun ||| Very hard! Do you know anyone with depression? ||| I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are better now ||| Probably not. I feel like nobody would expect their own husbands to kill their children. That is the last thing you think of ||| Do you think you are born with mental illness or something you develop? ||| That's interesting, now i understand it better ||| bye ||| Hi there, what did you think about the article? ||| Did you feel bad for the people in the camps? ||| Aww, what was the poor choice you think they made? ||| I still feel bad for the children though living in those conditions ||| I wonder if there's anything we can do to help ||| That's true. We have our own problems here as well ||| We also have children starving in America as well ||| I wonder if our next president will make immigration illegal ||| I would feel bad for them because they have no where to go ||| Interesting. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| bye ||| Well, what did you think? ||| It's terrible because we even waste food on the daily ||| I am guilty of that. I always end up throwing away leftovers ||| I a gree. Have you ever donated to charities with these causes ||| I agree. They could be going to the wrong places. Then sadly, there really is no other way to help ||| I hope that these people do actually get help and are not left dying ||| Yeah and all we can do is hear what is going on in the news but not actually know what is going on. ||| I wonder if any children from that area actually make it out and get a decent living ||| I agree. Let's hope it does happen though ||| Yup! It was nice talking to you. bye ||| Definitely. I just feel terrible for the dog. ||| So do you think the officer should be punished even though it was an accident? ||| I agree. Although accidents happen and i honestly don't think she should be punished for it though ||| That's a good enough punishment. I have a dog myself and i can't even begin to imagine how i would feel if this were to happen to me ||| Yeah overall, it was just very tragic and sad. ||| Yeah! I've been hearing so many stories of babies being locked in cars out in the heat. It's crazy ||| Yeah, at least there are decent people around to break the windows. ||| What would you have done if you saw the dog in the car? ||| I think i would have just broken the window lol ||| Oh wow, calling for help would definitely be the better choice for you. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| What happened to the wolf is so terrible. It makes me sad. ||| I wonder if the sniper will get punished for this. ||| I just can't believe people can kill an animal like this and be okay with it. ||| Exactly. The wolf probably has a family waiting for it as well. ||| Oh wow, that's interesting. What do you think of people that hunt for fun? ||| Yeah.. it just seems so cruel. Especially people that take pictures of the animal's body afterwards. So inhumane ||| That's just disturbing on so many levels! ||| I never even thought of it like that but it seems like a big problem. I wonder what people can do to help. ||| I might have to look that up later. I think hunting overall should be banned. I don't see the reason for it ||| Agreed. It was nice talking to you! ||| :( Let's hope things will improve in the future for animals. Bye ||| bye ||| Well? What did you think ||| I just feel bad because the wolf has a family ya know ||| Wow i didn't know that, very interesting. I just feel bad that humans can do such acts. |||  These tasks should never be easy, they should be hard. The fact that people can do it so easily just disgusts me ||| They are equal in my opinion. I just love animals too much ||| I agree as well. I just think that we should all be loving and not killing. ||| do you think its acceptable if a lion is attacking you to shoot it? ||| Definitely if my life is on the line , it should be shot ||| It's a shame really, animals are so beautiful ||| Exactly. Well it was nice talking to you, bye! ||| Seriously! I feel like if you lived in the country for a certain amount of years, you should be a citizen ||| Yeah it's just terrible that everything he worked for is just taken away from him. ||| Yeah, i can't even imagine what the man is going through.. ||| Wow, yeah there definitely needs to be a law in place to prevent things like this. I feel like if you've lived in the country for at least 10 years and had a job.. you should be eligible to stay ||| Agree 100%. It's crazy what's happening with our country. People use to look to use as the savior but not anymore. ||| Hopefully our next President can fix this and we continue to be the great country we once was ||| If you were the President, what would be your requirements to stay in the country if you can illegally? ||| Great points, how do you feel about overpopulation in the USA though with all the illegal immigrants ||| I think we both can agree that the US should go back to how we were regarding immigrants ||| Well i had a great chat with you! bye ||| I thought it was very disturbing and sad. You? ||| It's terrible. It's everywhere. Television.. social media. You just can't escape it. ||| It's definitely made me numb to any news i see. Even though the article we just read was terrible, it's nothing that we've never seen before ||| Agreed. Do you think the people that burned the body should get life in prison or even the death penalty? ||| I just can't even begin to imagine what goes through these people's heads. Do they have no remorse or emotion?! ||| Seriously, that definitely sounds like a death penalty to me. ||| True. This also makes me wonder if things like social media adds to the increasing amount of violence in the world today ||| It's sickening. It makes me sad to think about how much the world has changed. So many mass shootings and just hate in general. ||| I didn't think of that but that can definitely be true. When you watch those commercial on television, there's like 3 minutes of just side effects ||| Let's hope things get better in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| what a terrible situation overeall for everyone ||| i just cant imagine how you can kill another human ||| i dont think i can ever do that ||| do u think he deserve death sentence ||| thats good i think the same as well. he deserves it ||| Yes i just don't understand. These people hvae no remorse ||| I believe that criminals are born that way. What about u ||| I wonder what my brain scan will show ||| I hope so too. I hope the criminal got what he deserved in the end ||| Lets hope so. It was nice talking to you. bye! ||| I feel so bad for the elephant. Reminds me of Dumbo the movie. You? ||| I'm just imagining them taking the poor elephant away from it's family and being forced into entertainment. :( ||| Yeah, elephants are such sweet animals too. They wouldn't hurt a fly ||| I was actually in Thailand 2 years ago and got to feed and bathe elephants. It's so sad to read this. ||| yeah, it was a really cool experience. If you ever get the chance, i highly recommend going to Thailand and doing the same! ||| For sure. I hope there's laws in the future that prevent this from happening. ||| Hmm good question. I wonder if there's any underground illegal activity going on with elephants in the USA ||| Yeah all of this needs to stop. We're going to be sorry if elephants ever go extinct. :( ||| Yup, they're amazing and beautiful creatures. Well it was nice talking to you! ||| I will definitely think about it but it would not ruin my day. Thank you for asking! Bye! ||| bye ||| It was terrible. I feel so bad for the girl. ||| I think there was just tension and war in the area and the girl was caught in a bad situation ||| It's just sad that a civilian that has done no harm gets caught in something like this. ||| That's a great point. War sucks cuz civilian casualties are almost a guarantee ||| Agreed. I think i recently saw some news that US is sending in drones that killed a couple hundreds of civilians as well ||| I'm sure there are some out there. I can't even imagine having sight and next thing you know, you're blind. It's horrible ||| yeah, i never hear anything about this. All you see are celeb gossip and things of that nature ||| Sad to say but i definitely didn't know. I hope that girl is able to live a decent life ||| Totally forgot about the position she's in. Great point. Well let's just hope she's able to find a great husband! ||| Just shows that we're not really improving as humans. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| Agree. I just think that war in general is so terrible. ||| Yeah.. and the families of those that are in war. All they can do is worry and grieve ||| It's also sad to know that tehre is absolutely nothing we can do about this. ||| Hopefully they do something because so many innocent people are getting hurt and it's so unfair ||| I honestly don't even know but it does seem like forever. We should feel so grateful that we don't have to live life like those people. I can't even imagine ||| Yup! I'm just glad to have a roof over my head. You? ||| Have you ever traveled out of the US? ||| I've been to Thailand but even though it's third world, it's definitely not like the situation that we read in the article ||| Yup mostly visited temples. Looks like that's 10 turns, nice talking to you! bye ||| well? what did you think? ||| its terrible how can anyone do that ||| it's terrible. i would most likely not anymore, i would feel betrayed ||| That is what causes so much danger and robberies, because people have no money ||| I hope they have a better life in the future! ||| Even safe in their own home! these people are not safe anywhere ||| I wonder if the usa will help them ||| that is very sad but we also have our own problem ||| yes i agree. the world is very corrupt nowaday ||| True. Well it was nice to talk to you. bye ||| I thought it was very sad that innocent people are dying and getting hurt. You? ||| Do you think US investigating will be a good thing or will it hurt the US negatively? ||| Agree. I'm just thinking of the people that died and the families they had to leave behidn. So sad. ||| We should feel grateful that we don't have to go through that here. ||| Hopefully something is done to prevent more attacks in that country ||| Probably not. I don't think it's controllable. You? ||| The amount of people dying due to war  is terrible to think about. ||| Yeah, its sad to see that humans haven't evolved for the better ||| lol good point. Wonder if there's a charity we can donate to. ||| Well it was nice talking to you. bye ||| Hey there, what did you think about the article? ||| Same here. I can't believe there are people in this world that are that twisted. ||| I hope she is getting the support she needs. I don't think she will ever recover from this but i hope she has a good life. ||| I wonder what penalty the parents are going to get. ||| I feel like that's too little. They should get life or death penalty. Not only are they pedo, they're involved in incest as well. terrible. ||| Wow, i wonder if they've ever tried to contact one another ||| I don't think i'd ever be able to forgive my parents if that happened. What about you? ||| Wow i wouldn't kill them but i definitely would not want to talk to them! ||| I feel like it's already too late. The damage is done.. i would not accept it at all! ||| Yeah probably. Let's hope everything goes well for the daughter in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| hi, i thought it was very disturbing and sad. you? ||| I don't know how anyone in their right mind can do something like that! ||| If they can sexually assault their own child, who knows what else they will do ||| Exactly. do u think they deserve the death penalty ||| I think the same thing. I wonder if the child will ever forgive her parents ||| Yeah, i might want to kill them if i ever see them for what they did ||| yeah! and now u have to live with what happened forever ||| Yeah poor girl. I hope she is ok in the future ||| I agree. I can't believe there are peopel that are so evil in this world ||| Maybe! Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| bye ||| Hello what did you think about hte article ||| Definitely. I felt really disgusted after what ir ead ||| THe fact that you can sexually assault your own child is twisted ||| I hope they get life in prison or the death sentence ||| I agree. If you can do something like this, who knows what else you are capable of ||| I hope the child is okay in the future ||| definitely. i wonder if she can ever forgive her parents ||| Yeah i think i would be angry at my parents forever. ||| Maybe the girl will be able to get over this and become a successful young lady ||| True. Nice talking to you! bye ||| It sounds terrible. You have to actually feel the fire burning you before you die. ||| It's pretty slim. I feel so bad for the families of the ones that were lost. ||| I wish there was a way that i could help. I feel so bad ||| I agree. Do you know anyone that's ever been affected by a fire? ||| A friend of mine had his house burn down before. We were so young so i don't exactly remember what happened. ||| Nobody died. Everyone was okay thank the lord. ||| What do you think you would do if you survived a fire? ||| I would be really angry. I might go into depression and my anxiety would be off the roof. ||| Youre right. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| what did you think about the article?? ||| me too but it's scary because of someone else's accident ||| exactly! I would b so mad if my neighbor caused an accident that did me any harm ||| I agree. I hope these people learn from this stupid mistake. ||| do u think they should b put in jails ||| thats good. do u think they should pay for all the things they ruin ||| i agree. have you ever been burned before? ||| exactly! I cant even imagine being burned all over my body ||| i think i would rather just kill myself than the pain of burn ||| Hopefully! It was nice talking to you. bye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| It's terrible because it's something you can't avoid or fight ||| I agree. This reminds me of the case that happened in Thailand with the boys. ||| True. me too. I can't even imagine how hard it is to live on ||| Definitely. I can't even begin to think of what the people in the cave were thinking or feeling. THey must have been so scared ||| Have you ever been in a cave before? ||| Same here! I am also afraid of the dark and i get hungry easily. Those people in the cave must have been suffering. ||| I think i would faint or start screaming for no reason ||| Agreed. I wonder how long it took before the people in the cave died ||| Let's hope they're fine in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what u think about the article ||| It's terrible that someone can do this to others.. ||| Do you think people like this should be put behind bars forever ||| I agree! I believe he sexually assaulted multiple women as well ||| I wonder if people are just born that way. ||| definitely! I hope he gets what he deserves ||| I hope they aren't scarred for life. ||| I agree. I just wonder how can someone be so tempted that they'd be willing to commit a crime ||| Yeah, let's hope people are better in the future and we evolve as humans. ||| It was nice talking to you!! bye ||| I felt so sad! What about you my friend? ||| I can't even imagine if i was the parent of the child. I would be in depressio nforever ||| Yeah i think it said that he fell in while helping his family harvest vegetables. So sad.. ||| Exactly! But accidents happen, what can you do ||| Have you ever gotten into any life threatening dangers? ||| I would say one time i accidentally burned myself on the stove, that's about it ||| That's good. I own a dog and if something were to happen to him, i would be devastated... let alone my own child! ||| I have a sharpei, i love him to death. Now i understand why my parents use to nag me for being out too late as a teenager! ||| Yeah! I hope that boy's family is able to have a decent life moving forward ||| It was nice talking to you!! bye ||| It's terrible. All those poor wildlife in the waters.. ||| Same here. I never recycle so i am definiteliy part of the issue as well. We need to do better! ||| How long do you think it will take until we can actula feel the damages? ||| You're right. We recently had a huge thunderstorm and it was bigger than anything i've ever seen! ||| It sucks that animals and wildlife have to suffer because of us. ||| I wish i could donate or help the animals somehow. ||| I should definitely do that. Do you donate? ||| That's still good. I remember seeing a picture of a duck with some plastic stuck to it's head, it was so sad. ||| That sounds even worse. I am going to volunteer to clean up a beach one day. ||| Great! It was nice talking to you. bye ||| I feel terrible for these poor creatures ||| God entrusted humans to take care of them, however, humans tend to be very destructive! ||| yes, it's unavoidable, a lot of selfish people in the world ||| They should, God meant for it, it says in the Bible that we should have dominion over the animals, we were made in his image and have a soul ||| yes, too many species die out! in the last 200 years we lost 200o species-learnt that from my child's science book! ||| I would do it for littering ||| all but China-the trash can and the worst offender! They poison everything around. Not to mention the mercury in the ocean and radiation from Japan that reached the coast of California ||| Yes, but some nations are still living in dark ages-take India, they defecate into their own rivers and wash their cothes right there at the same time ||| pretty much nothing-that's their culture and way of life, they are poor and uneducated, we cannot help everybody, look where it got us-our economy and everything in the toilet, we cannot be the savior and have to focus on our own needs ||| yes, and hopefully this cleanup mission will be fast and effective ||| thank you same here, goodbye! ||| Hello, what did you think about the article? ||| Yeah seriously! The parents need to be more responsible ||| It's so sad because these children had their whole lives ahead of them! ||| Exactly. I'm not sure if you can even prevent this ||| That's a great idea. Do you have children of your own? ||| I don't but i can't even imagine the horror the parents must have felt when they arrived home and saw what happpened with their child ||| Yeah! I hope the families that went through this are okay now though ||| That's true. I have a dog and i get terrified when i eat chocolate because i don't want to drop any ||| I wonder if Opioids are even needed, or if there is some alternate solution to prescribe to people that is more safe ||| I can agree with that. Let's hope this crisis is dealt with and we have less dying children. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| I agree. It's terrible and sad. ||| Exactly! i don't think i would ever forgive myself if i killed my own child. ||| Do you think people like this should not be allowed to have children forever? ||| I think so as well! I feel like it's hard for people to change. ||| I agree. Childrens lives are in danger because of so many careless adults ||| That's true. Even though what the parents did was terrible, it was not on purpose and i hope they have a somewhat decent life moving forward ||| How would you feel if you were the aprent in the situation ||| I would most likely do the same. I would probably be in depression for many years as well ||| Yup! It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article ||| Poor flamingo was just minding it 's own business and got attacked! ||| That's terrible! I've never heard that. I wonder what kind of consequences this man is going to face ||| I would say at least a couple years in jail! The fact that you can just go up to an animal and slam it to the ground sounds.. disturbing ||| Yeah! Exactly. It's sad how not only are we destroying the homes of animals but now we're abusing them as well ||| I don't think it's ever going to change sadly. ||| True. I saw a video of people abusing elephants and it made me want to cry ||| I think sadists or just the fact that they think animals are just a .. thing, with no emotions ||| Definitely. I live in Florida too so Busch Gardens is only a 2 hour drive from me. Very sad ||| Let's hope things improve in the future for both humans and animals. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| It's terrible what is happening to the world today! ||| Do you think it is human caused? ||| I wonder what will be done to fix the destruction. ||| I care! I wish that i could donate to these wildlife charities ||| lol that's a good point. Do you own any pets or anything? ||| Wow. Do you feel compassion or anything for them if htye were to get hurt? ||| Awesome. How long have you had this goat? ||| That's a pretty good deal. I hope you will treat it well because it's sad what humans are doing to animals. ||| That's interesting. Hopefully you will keep it more as a pet ||| Cool! Well it was nice talking to you. bye ||| hi what you think my friend? ||| I feel sad because even though it's not as sad now, it will affect them mroe in the future ||| It's because of humans do you think? ||| I wish there was a way we can donate ||| There are charity but you never know if the money actually goes to the right places ||| I agree, most of the money goes to bad intentions! ||| I wish the money could help the animals somehow. They really need it ||| Yes! I definitely feel guilty because ive littered before and not recycle ||| That is very good. You sound like a great person! ||| I agree. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| It's so sad what happened to the soldiers i agree ||| I read that too, it's so sad. I can't even imagine just going about your business and then getting bombed. ||| It would definitely hurt lol. I feel bad for the families of the civilians ||| that sounds very sad. and disturbing... ||| I agree. We have everything we need and no wars. ||| I'm sure they will. I just hope global warming doesn't affect them. ||| True. I wonder how long this is goign to continue for ||| I hope in the next 5 years, things will be better. ||| nice chatting with you! bye ||| Hello! What did you think about the article? ||| It's so disturbing that diseases are being carried around. ||| Me neither but just imagine if you got bit by a squirrel and you some how got it.. it's terrifying ||| I don't believe so. There are always squirrels in front of my house. I'm scared to leave the house now ||| I have a dog, now you're making me nervous! ||| Do you own any pets? ||| I would try to avoid them as much as possible! I wonder what happened to the people that got affected by the squirrels ||| I think it did. Leprosy is the worst though. You just lose body parts ||| I think so. It's just sad. Something so unexpected like a squirrel can kill you ||| It's just a terrible case overall. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| It's so sad. It's unfortunate the children had to grow up in that environment. ||| True but i still feel bad. I read there was babies under the buildings ||| True. I did read recent news about Americans bombing innocent civilians too though :( ||| I wonder if there's anything that can be done to decrease the amount of civilian deaths ||| Who's Timmy? Also, i hope the families are all okay after this terrible incident. ||| I live in Chicago and it's definitely sad what is going on there. I care about all children, doesn't matter where they're from! ||| That's a good question. I would say whoever is suffering more ||| Then i will have to say Chicago only because it's closer to me and hits home more ||| I agree. we need to make America great again ||| I definitely did not know that . It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hey there, what did you think of the article? ||| Exactly! And to think of the families they left behind as well ||| It's terrifying. I think i would go in to severe depression ||| I'm not sure if it was in the article, but i hope no children were harmed! ||| That's good. I read an article this morning about innocent civilians being killed..and there were babies involved ||| Yeah it was sad to read. I hope the families of the lost ones will be able to live a happy life in the future ||| I agree. I wish there was a way that we can help ||| I don't think it will get better anytime soon unfortunately and it sucks there's nothing that can be done to fix it ||| Would you be okay if USA were to accept people from that country into our own? ||| Sounds like you're a great person. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article? ||| It was so sad. How can someone do things like this to an animal ||| I couldn't even kill an ant, let alone a cat! ||| Do you own any pets? ||| I have a dog too! I would be so sad if someone were to hurt it ||| Same here. I wonder what the owners of the cat did afterwards ||| I agree. I hope that person goes to jail too. ||| It's interesting. Do you think the person will ever harm another animal? ||| I hope they don't move on to bigger things and do this to other humans. ||| True. Well it was nice talking to you. bye ||| Hello what did you think about the article? ||| I agree. I feel so bad for these soldiers. ||| The fact that they have families at home just makes it worse! ||| It's just sad that there are still wars going on and people are dying. We should be better than that. ||| IT is but people shouldn't be killing one another ||| I hope no children were harmed. ||| Yeah, i read an article about babies being killed this morning, it was so sad ||| Yes, poor things. Well it was nice talking to you, bye ||| Oh sorry about that, i think this is the last turn. I think Syria should really try to improve relations with other countries to prevent more deaths. ||| Yup, let's hope everything goes well for them in the future. bye! ||| I was able to understand the Jewish people and why they were angry. You ||| They're probably still thinking about what happened back the nand the history. ||| Definitely. I wonder which president Jewish people are supporting in the upcoming election ||| I agree. Do you know any Jewish people? ||| I don't know any at all. I wish i did so i can ask them about this situation ||| I don't. I disagree with his views and the way he is overall. You? ||| Do you have a nominee in mind for next election? I have been interested in Andrew Yang. ||| Same! The UBI is nice too. But back to this, i hope things get better for the Jewish people in the future ||| Let's hope it happens! ||| Well it was nice talking to you! Let's hope for a better future for everyone. bye ||| I thought it was very sad what happened to the victims. You ||| Yeah, i ride trains all the time so this is scary ||| Wow! That's very interesting. Whats the reason for never riding on a train? ||| Wow thats very cool. Have you ever flown? ||| Trains are very convenient. There's almost a stop everywhere ||| Yes i do, i use both ways of transportation. But about the story, i feel so bad for the families of the victims ||| Yeah definitely. Let's hope they have a decent future moving forward ||| Yeah! I would have gone into depression if i saw something like that.. ||| I wonder what the world would be like without trains ||| I can see that. Well it was nice talking to you! bye ||| ahoy, what did you think about the article? ||| I agree, i am guilty of it myself to be honest ||| Do you just throw it away then? ||| Nice, i usually just turn it into a shake of some sort! ||| Vegetables and rice ||| True! What kind of food do you cook the most? ||| That sounds delicious. I wish i knew how to make that ||| I usually just eat rice with some eggs. That's it ||| I am 40 years old unfortunately ||| That's awesome. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| I thought that it was very vague. It doesn't even give a back story but i feel bad for hte police ||| I read the article a while ago, but didnt it mention a police getting killed? ||| That's weird. Although mine did mention the shooter barricaded in the house. It was a weirdly worded article overall. Do you think the police are too aggressive? ||| I agree. There's definitely bad police out there but only the bad ones are shown on media outlets like you said. The other 80% don't get credit ||| Yeah, i've never had any bad experiences with police but then again, i never retaliate. Have you ever run into bad police? ||| That's good. You should like you have your head on straight and not influenced by others much ||| Hm i think that they should be harder to get ahold of. People thinking that taking away semi-auto rifles will automatically stop mass killings are dead wrong. People will always find other ways ||| Yeah i suffer depression and anxiety myself and sometimes i feel like these people just need someone to talk to because they feel alone in the world. There was a recent video where a teacher stopped a shooter and began hugging him and the shooter started tearing up i believe. It was very sad. ||| Would you wish for a world that doesn't have social media at all? Or back to the old days with only instant messaging and texting. ||| I use it and seeing all these people flaunt their wealth does get to me. It makes you feel small . I believe this is the 10th turn. It was nice talking to you! Finally someone that answers and doesn't just type random things. Bye! ||| bye ||| That was so disturbing to read. I agree, i can't believe someone can not only kill the children but also the dog? ||| Interesting people. I suffer from depression as well but i don't think i would ever do something that extreme. ||| Yes! Which is why everyone thinks people with depression are \dangerous\"" or people just want to stay away form them."" ||| These people need more help instead of people hating them you are right ||| probably not, it was just a very messed up situatino. I still can't believe she couldn't even let the dog go. ||| I don't even know the logic. I'm trying to see it from her side and maybe she did it so the children don't grow up traumatized or whatever, but the  dog?? Why?! ||| That's true, i was thinking more of the dog was outdoors and after she killed her family, she went out and shot the dog before shooting herself ||| I don't believe i read anything about her. I jsut remember the husband's family saying HE was a working man. This is some Amityville Horror type stuff ||| Good question, i might just search up the article because this is pretty interesting. It was nice talking to you! bye ||| Hi what u think? ||| me too. i think they are hiding it to be honest ||| I think so. why would he just kill himself ||| I see him probably fell down and hurt himself maybe? ||| I feel bad for the guy's family ||| Maybe, I can see you dying from a fall but it would not involve your whole body ||| I have never fell while drinking have you? ||| Yeah it could have been murder ||| Do you think maybe he was force to kill himself ||| Or he could have slipped on something. Either way, i feel bad for the poor man. He was probably very nice. ||| ok thank you. bye!"
p023,"This is really a shame with whats going on. I feel like the war on terror has been a massive failure. We have lost soldiers. I think of how many families no longer have their children any longer. Then the situation in the Middle East is heartbreaking as well. Young kids, some teenagers have been used as pawns in this sick game. Women are being treated like pieces of meat.I wish I could say that there was something that we as a nation can do, but the situation looks pretty bleak. I think maybe the best thing to do is to stop invading these countries for their oil. It's our own fault in many ways. ||| The government of India makes a lot of money from coal production, but they do not take into account who this is affecting the most. Both the people and the elephants are being hit the hardest, not to mention the forests that are being destroyed. There have been 75 deaths of people and 30 deaths of elephants. People are having respiratory problems. Just imagine the children being affected. It's a travesty. People need clean air and water to live and it's like the government doesn't care. Someone needs to step up and do something.","Tell me about it. What a shame that the government of India isn't taking action. It's all about profit to them it seems. ||| It's such a shame and a human rights abuse. Every living creature for that matter has a basic right to clean air and water. I couldn't imagine how bad it must be living near one of those mines. ||| Any change with government happens when people join together en mass. They need to be protesting outside of every politicians office. They should also spread this story to the international community to publicly shame their officials. Do you have any ideas of what can be done? ||| I can think of how in the US change was created with the civil rights movement, and the women's movement when people stood together. I think that because people like us know about the story we can help by sharing this information on social media. We can be the media for them. But what can be done about the poor elephants? They have lost their homes because of the forest's being destroyed. ||| Ultimately yes. So it's up to everyone to make sure their government works in their best interest. Some people not even receiving compensation was terrible, but what about the kids who lost their lives? No amount of money can replace life. ||| There should be some sort of a program that helps these elephants get transported to a place where their homes won't be destroyed. Do you know of any charities that could help? ||| You really don't think they would allow international help? I will pose the question... What would you do if this were happening in your hometown? ||| You make a really good point. I wasn't thinking about that. ||| I've actually heard about that a while ago. Like I stated earlier... They care about profits over people. ||| I'm afraid that they will hurt these communities to the point where they create a refugee crisis. ||| At the very least I wonder if we could donate things like breathing masks? Maybe that could help some to breath a bit better. Or if there is a way to get them clean water delivered. ||| I would imagine that we could set up a GoFundMe campaign. That's definitely one way to go about it. ||| There are alternative platforms. I would be happy to research them in detail. Charities can be looked into as well. ||| It's the least we can do, and like I said, posting on social media would help raise awareness. I just wish we could wave a wand and these communities would have clean air and water. ||| bye ||| Hey there. SO I found this article absolutely heartbreaking. Such a bad situation for so many. ||| It's just insane. I feel like the war on terror has been a massive failure. ||| I wholeheartedly agree. I hate to say it, but I think our country being involved in perpetuating these regime change wars does more harm than good. ||| Agreed. They need to handle their problems on their own. In many cases we say it's to spread democracy, but a majority of middle east countries just want to run things their own way. I feel terrible about the kids there that have been indoctrinated. The poor parents may never have their kids back. ||| It's pretty ridiculous. It's not just the kids either. The women are treated like second rate citizens. The article mentioned how women are being \redistributed\"". That's pretty sick."" ||| I wouldn't doubt that at all. I think the fact that they are using white flags as a way of disguising bombs is reprehensible. It would be great if all of the middle east countries came together to fix their problems. ||| Your right. If people would just open their minds a little bit, they would find that there are good and bad people in every religious sect. I know some people that are in fact Muslim that completely disavow what's going on. ||| I haven't seen any progress. I think that the more our military has a presence there, the more hostile the area becomes until it's completely destabilized. This is one of the paths towards radicalization. I will never get over the fact that they are brainwashing children to be cold blooded killers. ||| Yeah for sure. I can only imagine the brutal techniques used to radicalize them at such a young age. They should be doing kid stuff. Not being forced to participate in avts of war. ||| It's hard to get your mind around it. Reading this gave me some pretty disturbing images, so one can only imagine what it's like to live in this nightmare. ||| It's no wonder there are so many fleeing. I would do the same. ||| bye"
p024,"I wonder why there aren't more people trying to help these people. I understand Haiti is not the richest nor less corrupt country but surely there must be a way to help. Supplies being looted by crowds is understandable because they are hungry and people need food and water to survive. We must think of other ways to distribute the food and water. ||| I feel sad that elephants can't even be protected how they should be. The fact that a bid to give them high level protection was defeated tells me that money rules overall and it has been that way and will always be that way and it is something I can not just grasp my head around and accept as a fact of life because it just is not fair. ||| Bullying isn't a new thing and it is something that must be dealt with swiftly. We must find a way to fix this stuff because it is not new and keeps happening around us. Not only in France but all around the world kids suffer from this and it leads to many suicides. The pressure from other kids is huge. ||| I think this is a terrible tragedy because the victims at dreamworld were there to have fun not to die. More needs to be done to test these roller coasters to make sure that it does not happen anymore. Unfortunately it happens too often more than it should and we do not hold these park authorities accountable.  ||| We need to stop bullying of kids because in my opinion it is the main culprit in kids committing suicide! We need to find a way to stop that because kids dont deal with peer pressure like us adults do! The faster we find a way to stop this the quicker we find a solution to deaths of kids by suicide methods! ||| Unfortunately in countries like these the officials are so corrupt you can't expect any justice to be made. I feel like overall it is what makes the most sense to me. Not expecting justice is a normal thing in Nigeria. I feel like there is no two ways about it and overall I feel disappointed that us as a world can only sit back and watch and not do anything about it. ||| Its a sad thing when this happens in teh world. I feel like these disasters can always be prevented but they rarely are. I think overall we need to be more careful and do measures to prevent these things from happening. I feel like the water when it comes from the river is better like it was said in the article. ||| I've personally been involved in a major quake when I was In Mexico City on vacation a few years back. The floor scrambling under me was quite scary and overall one of the most fearful thing. I think it was one of the most dangerous things I have seen in quite some time. I also felt a lot as a kid in california. ||| Its really sad when these types of things happen. I feel like we need to do more to help these sort of people. I also understand that they are human like us and they have feelings too. Doctors without Borders does what it can  but it can only do so much without external help. The fact  that they are displaced by conflict and persecution makes me feel like we need to help countries first. ||| this is just sad no one expects to die in a crash like this. I feel like overall it is very depressing and just quite sad. The fact that Lina was returning home from church when they were hit makes it even sadder. I feel like they need to find a way to prevent these crashes although it is quite hard for me to pinpoint exactly what to do. ||| This tends to happen a lot in relationships. It seems like a lot of people don't feel good enough for the other person and this tends to lead to these feelings. I feel like everyone goes through this and it is up to us to change that by thinking positively more so than not. I feel like pressure from others leads to these negative feelings. ||| The fires that killed more than 100,000 people just disappoint me honestly. I feel like overall there has to be a better way to go about things this is just depressing and we need to find better ways to help them out. I feel like there needs to be people held accountable for this just leaving it like this is not going to cut it. ||| We as a whole community of human beings must come together to save this beautiful majestic animals. WE have obviously not learned our lesson of past animal extinctions and still put endangered animals in even more danger. Norway should put out strict laws for visitors and harsh sentences should they break these laws as well! ||| This is just depressing because the little rhino was a famous one. I feel like I lost a pet of mine to be honest. It seems this rhino was quite important and when someone like that goes it is quite depressing and hard to put in to words.The fact the orphanage had no power is depressing. We need to do better  ||| I think its about time Saudi Arabia get with the rest of the worlds in the push for women to be treated equally. It is a shame that women need consent of a male guardian to go abroad. They are adults and should be free to travel where they wish. I think the need for consent is something from the 1400's and should be abolished now. ||| I feel the asylum process is very, very bad in most countries not just Germany. For example in USA it is pretty bad as well. WE need to do better in letting people in to be honest. I feel like it isn't fair that some countries don't get let in as easy as others. IT might have to do with crisis's in countries but it is not fair. ||| This is something that is hard to choose sides with.  When people seek asylum its fine to want to help. At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it. I think what Germany needs is to overhaul their immigration laws and make a change down the middle where asylum is fair but realistic. ||| We must do something to stop these companies from getting rid of what forest and animals we have left. The fact that orangutans are an endagered species angers me. What have we as humans done to prevent this? I think nothing. If something is done it would be totally unimpressive and do nothing. What we need to do is all come together and work towards the same goal. ||| I think police need to be checked for how they treating protestors. These native people are in the right defending their own land and should not be maced for doing so. The native american people in this country have suffered enough. Its time we give them something good instead of bad again. They deserve this land. ||| I think it must be investigated thoroughly and if true this man should be removed from his position immediately. Groping is just as bad as rape in my honest and humble opinion and should be removed fast. I think a precedent has to be set to stop these things and in order for that to happen we must be able to iron the bad ones out. ||| Its a good thing the cops are asking for help because I dont feel like anyone else would at this point. The fact that the woman was found wandering in the middle of the night without a coat is scary. It also goes to show that most people do not help others. She was confused and obviously drugged I just hope she gets the help she needs. ||| Anytime these tragedies happen one can't help but wonder what could've been done to prevent this? The fact that 3,800 are dead is just mind boggling. Drowning continues and its at 90 a week that is just crazy. They have no choice one must assume but surely we can help better those countries? We must do something. ||| I remember reading about her growing up during the Bush era. She seemed to be a rude person with that whole Elian Gonzales saga. However we must pay our respects every time somebody dies. For that I really feel like she should be honored and I hope people close to her find peace after all of this loss. ||| I remember as a child watching Janet Reno in the news. Never really know what s he did back then just knew that she was a big part of the Elian Gonzales case when he was deported back to Cuba. This is crazy and honestly I'm surprised to hear her name again and its unfortunate it has to be under these circumstances. ||| I'm starting to feel like these militants dont represent that whole religion as a whole. I feel like they are twist to the religion that is out to give them a bad name., Kidnapping children is just too low even for the hardest of criminals. WE must do something to stop this and that is hurting their finances and freezing all of their bank accounts. ||| these hate crimes have been rising lately and i feel it is due to more than just terrorists. These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this. The fact that we haven't fixed things yet is quite scary and we need to do the right thing and take steps to clean up the problem. ||| This breaks my heart because no children should have to go through this! I really want to help these kids not go hungry and will look into how I can help after this. I feel like to be honest it is our duty and should be mandatory that we help these kids. It is the best thing overall because no one seems to be helping them. ||| Why is the rest of the world just sitting around watching this go on. It disgusts me that we are sitting idly by watching these children get abused. I understand it is not America's problem but it is all our problem when children are being hurt . We must stand up and fix this, its the right thing to do no matter what. ||| I think its sad what is happening in Nigeria with the hunger crisis. What happened to Zulyatu and he siblings making the mother flee to Biu is just crazy. I think we should step in as a nation and do the right thing here. It is the correct thing to do honestly and we must get it done as quick as possible. ||| This is sad as somebody with elderly parents the thought of them dying alone is quite scary. We must be able to fix this and the best way how is to just overall understand that they need help. We must strive to do better. To do better means helping them out. There is little dignity in that kind of life since everyone else flees and leaves them alone. ||| What is with dog owners lately? This isn't the first story I read in the past few months of a dog being left inside a hot car. I believe the owner should be charged and not called an accident! The owner had to know the risks! Its time we hold these people accountable. It is not fair to the dog nor to the people that have to rescue the dog! ||| The immigration system in this country is terrible there is no other way around it. The fact that this man was raised here since 3 and still not given citizenship? Give me a break. There are far too many stories like this and what angers me the most is that nothing is being done to fix this. We must do better. ||| Stuff like this is crazy because it is Halloween and kids are expected to be walking the street. You would, or at least I would think that people would be more aware and feel like they have to drive more carefully than usual because at the end of the day they do have to just be more careful overall since kids will be walking the streets during Halloween. ||| We need gun control now. The amount of deaths like this airline worked being gunned down is everyday news at this point. Everyday is a new story about a new death due to guns. Pro gun activists say that cars or tobacco kill people more but those arent made to kill people and guns are and they do kill people. ||| The fact that it wasn't criminals that did this to the poor girl but security personnel speaks volumes on the world as a society. Pellets are seen as not harmful but the reality is they c an even cause blindness. We must do what is right and correct the wrongs in society by educating people on the harms that they cause. ||| I believe that the photographer that happened to describe the life of Insha hit the nail on the head with this description of the life of her after the blindness. A pellet gun has up to 500 pellets and the fact that  she was hit by these pellets in a Kashmir tell me they are not properly trained. I feel like this is a problem all throughout the world. We need to train people better. ||| This isn't the first time it seems like the US has backed what looks to be a group of terrorists. I feel like we as a country need to do better and investigate just who we support much better than we are currently doing. I think the sooner we do it the more luck we will have in making this world a better place. ||| I think when accidents like this happen we must sit back and wonder why they happened and what can be done to prevent them in the future. I feel like this Arizona apartment complex probably did not have the necessary protocols to do things the right way and that caused this to happen. We must ensure all buildings have the necessary steps to prevent this. ||| We need to do more to protect life. The fact that this Flamingo died is mind boggling because it was a visitor that did it. With Busch Gardens considers themselves a serious institution they will most certainly end up having to press charges on this guy it is the least they can do here to be quite honest with you. ||| Troops killed in Afghanistan always angers because we should no longer be there in the first place. The fact that we are still there says a lot about us as a country. We need to realize that we have no business there anymore and get out. I don't know why we try to be the world police when it clearly does us no good in the long run. ||| How someone can have the cold heart to strangle a living thing let alone a baby kitten to death is beyond me.  Imagine the pain the poor thing felt? How can we let people that do these things continue to live amongst us. Surely there must be some justice for this? What a disturbing case if I've ever seen one. ||| I understand that there are more good cops than bad cops and overall cops are needed in society, but at what point do we start training these guys more than they are trained? Literally anybody can be a cop it seems and all these viral videos of cops hurting people are all too common. This is why a lot of the public is growing a huge distrust for cops. ||| I can relate to the Jewish in the sense that I too struggle to realize and accept the fact that Trump got elected. I think the realization that he got elected is one that I tend to think  made me realize the USA was not the country I thought it was. At the end of the day its good that it happened because we realized that we are not perfect as a country. ||| Anytime a train or car crash happens you start to think of what caused it. You wonder if the conductor was drunk or what? Usually there is a hidden reason as to why they happened and a lot of the time we never find out what truly happened. Its near the site of a 2013 crash though which leads me to believe that this happens regularly there! ||| We shouldn't be wasting food like that us Americans when there are so many starving children around the world. We need to find a way to preserve leftover food , renew it and give it to the people in need. It can be the homeless or children in need. The bottom line is we need to make better use of the food so other people can enjoy it. ||| PTSD is something I personally know because I have friends with it. It is no joke and really makes people feel vulnerable. The troubles of war are something real dangerous and really make you think twice about enlisting. I think we must do what we can to research this and hope for better outcomes for people. ||| I feel like overall it is quite sad that this happened and it should have been prevented by the proper authorities. I feel like as a people we should do what we can to prevent these things.  I feel like the fact that the city reacted well is a good sign. I think they did the right thing in not letting muslims security personnel enter as you have to take all precautions necessary. ||| When tragedies like the one in Paris happen we must dig down deep and look for proper solutions. I think we need to research what goes through people's heads when they commit crimes like this.It was a little racist for one of them to say muslim security collaborated with the criminals. That was a bad thing to say. ||| Its quite sad when crashes like these happen and when they do happen I can't help but feel like something could have been done to prevent it. I feel like as humans we do not do enough to try and prevent all of these crashes. The fact that it was a routine training flight with the aerobatics team makes it worse. IT was also the first woman to fly a China j_10 fighter. ||| I feel like bullying is not something new and the fact that we still have not done anything about it is repulsive. We are not doing enough in preventing bullying or educating kids about how bad they really are. I think we need to understand that and teach these kids that there are other way to go about things.  ||| It is quite sad that a father and son fell off a cliff like this after a simple hike. The helicopter power failure however is totally uncalled for and should be looked into by the proper authorities there is no way it should be allowed to happen like that because overall help needs to be there when needed asap. ||| I think there should be STRICT world laws to prevent people and countries that cant have zoos not to have them. It is unfortunate that in 2019 this is s till happening and we should totally fix this. We need to be able to get it right and to be honest the only way is being the world police and stopping them from doing this. ||| More than 40 people were hurt and it is quite depressing any time anyone is hurt. I feel like the best thing we can do is be sure that we get things right in the long run and change the way things are ran. I feel like we should be sure to change things for the better.. The fact that air strikes still hurt innocent people is mind blowing. ||| When people split up it not only affects them but it affects the kids as well. The kids have to deal with the burden of having to live separate lives between time spent with the mom, and all the time they have to spend with the dad. I feel like this causes a toll on their childhood and they are not the same when they grow up because of it. ||| Its always sad when these things happen because we are humans at the end of the day. I feel like civilians for the most part are innocent and it doesn't make sense that people do this to compete innocent people. We must find a way to prevent these unnecessary  wars and fighting that leads to no proper solution to problems ||| the fact that the pets died is heart breaking. I can't imagine that the pets died and to be honest it was quite depressing. The fact that the pets are gone means they have lost a lot of valuable memoires with them. I feel like when you lose someone like this it is quite hard to get over it one can only pray and hope they find relief. ||| This is just disgusting and makes me really doubt us as human beings. The fact that children are exposed to this really makes me doubt who we are as a people. I understand it is in Myanmar and not in the states but that should not mean anything and we should still be able to help these innocent children. ||| IT angers me that we put out that plastic in the ocean for these animals in the first place. These animals do not know any better and we need to fi nd ways to improve these conditions I feel like anything other than changing the way we recycle is just not enough. Especially in these times that global warming is prevalent! ||| I think its really sad we need to do something these animals are precious and do not deserve to be killed off not only unknowingly but also so scary. Imagine flying like a free bird and all of a sudden facing a sudden death at the hands of these wind turbines. That is something just scary overall to be quite honest. ||| The violence due to guns in this co0untry is becoming way too prevalent. We must do something to fix it but the republicans seem to be too much into gun control. I feel like that is the downside of things. There needs to be a better dialogue between both parties because too many people are dying at the hands of guns. ||| I think what happens is just too sad. Anytime attacks like these are done on innocent people you can't help but try and think of ways you can prevent this. Paris is such a long historic place too and  to have these attacks happen there really makes you wonder if there is any place that is safe. That is the truth. ||| Its always sad when these tragedies occur. We must cohesively find ways to improve this and lessen the chances these attacks occur. I just wonder what we can do though. We have to be able to make a positive change and to be honest the only way to do that is to have stricter laws. These laws would mean less freedom but I am okay with that. ||| I feel like as humans we should all feel the need to help them out. I think in cases like these were its a country that has very low resources with violence all around there should be some sort of humanitarian aid for the people. I believe very strongly that anything else is just not that good overall. ||| Aleppo has been having these problems for quite a while now. I feel like the bombings are just the top of the cake in terms of letting the world know about what is wrong with them. I feel like they really need to change things and in order to do that they need the help of the world more so than anything else. ||| I think its wrong for people to be attacked just because of a select few that make a religion look bad. There are also some bad christians out there and we dont base our whole view on things based on the fact that they were christian. We must learn to differentiate between the two to be honest it makes the most sense. ||| I think this man must of been going through quite a bit of problems in his life to do this! I feel like when someone does this we must check and see what was the cause. We don't know the full details of the story yet. I think we must first realize what happened clearly and why it happened to see the truth there. ||| I feel like something must be done about these poachers. Not only do they oppose the fact that poaching is wrong but they attack people that try and defend these animals. It is just wrong and I am fed up with  it. There must surely be more moral than immoral people in this world and we must act now to save these animals. ||| The fact that these villagers are placing money they receive from these poachers in order to side with them and attack anti poachers unit of rangers is pathetic. It shows that money really is the root of all evil! I can not believe it to be honest! It makes my blood boil that people do not care for these animals being hurt for profit. ||| The fact that civilians have to be hurt in the process of trying to get rid of the Taliban is mind boggling. Surely there can be better intelligence found that can fix this and honestly the fact that there is not makes me feel like we are not doing it right. We need to find ways to minimize the risk these civilians take by being in the crossfire. ||| I feel like the treatment of those children is depressing. What is it about these people that they feel the need to do this? Something must be done but what? The 50 people tha took the census and put the population at 10,188 did a great job and the fact that they say there is no drinking water and the toilets are never cleaned angers me. ||| Anything fellow human beings are struggling with hunger we as humans must find a way to be able t o  help them out. I feel like if we are starving we would want as Americans someone to step in and help us. It is the right and the only way to do things to be honest. I feel like Nigeria is too corrupt to help itself at this point. ||| I think situations like these really make me doubt the world. We really need to do better and I've been saying this for quite some time now but eventually you realize its a crazy world out there. So much wrong goes on in the world that you become numb to it over time. I think that is the worst part of it. ||| This is ridiculous! This man is American through and through. He is about as South Korean as me. He was born in this country and he is a citizen more so than most Americans as far as I am concerned. He should be allowed to come back no doubt about it! Its quite infuriating to be quite honest with you! ||| When crimes like this happened it is always good that the perpetrators are caught quickly because they can strike again at anytime. I feel like in this case the bloody evidence was good even if the body was burned so that just tells me that these criminals were not as smart as they thought which led to them being caught. ||| it is quite depressing to see what this elephant has had to go through throughout his life. I feel like this female elephant being held captive for 3 decades is enough to depress me. Not only does it get worse than that, it still has no signs of changing. We as humans need to stand up and do what is right. ||| This angers me to know stuff like this still goes on in 2019. The fact that another country has to help another with troops shows that we aren't in better times like some people say. Kenya  deported an official knowing he was most likely to die when he arrived back in Sudan. This is cold blooded and Kenya should be ashamed of themselves for this. ||| I feel like they are doing the right thing. These animals and children at the zoo should not be taking in this second-hand smoke. I feel like the correct thing to do is fix it and try and get these smokers out of there as soon as possible. I think  children should be protected and this is the correct way to do it. ||| I feel like in order to fight Cholera correctly we have to understand it. Its a good sign that no one agrees how to do it in my opinion because that just means that we need to find better ways to fight it. IT also means people are trying to agree just can't. That is a good sign because people are willing to talk about a solution. ||| I feel like this is a problem not just with this Cholera situation but with humanity in general. WE can never just come together and form a common agreement we always seem to end up on the wrong side of things and disagreeing.. We tend to never agree on things and this causes disagreements like this. If we just worked things out correctly we would be better off. ||| I feel like this is the type of attack that has no excuse.  Maybe the troops dislike the religion of muslims but this is no way to go about things just attacking them in this manner. The reporter that was fired for reporting on this issue has my respect, she tried to bring it to light and lost her job trying to let the voice of these women to be spoken. ||| It is always depressing when things like this happen. I feel like the coal business has always been a very dangerous one and we need to be able to realize that no matter what we do to try and change things, they will somehow someway always be the old fashioned way with old fashioned dangers. I think we need to find a way these workers get safer jobs. ||| These attacks on women seem to be more prevalent lately than not. I think with our current president and his feelings about women it has increased these attacks. We need to be aware of this and make the changes accordingly. We need to be able to prevent these attacks before they happen but finding out how to do that is the tough thing. ||| I had to read this article over twice because toddlers overdosing on opioids is mind boggling! I wonder how and why they have access to this. I know its because sometimes parents drop these pills but if parents are that bad, why are they having kids in the first place? We need laws that test people before they have children in order to make sure they will be good parents. ||| We need to do more to protect the wildlife in this world. The fact that we let rivers and land go so littered with these carcasses but do nothing to try and help alleviate the situation. We need to do better. I think with time we might improve on this but I won't get my hopes up. We as humans are not the most caring species it seems. ||| We need to run more tests on other animals and see what they carry as well. I think the fact that we are just barely now finding this out is troublesome. With the millions of different animal species around the world there is a guarantee that they carry more diseases that we are not aware of as well. ||| The fact that 13 civilians were killed shows that this rivalry between India and Pakistan is something that needs to be fixed. They were killed in Pakistan land as well and India should be the one to blame here if what they're saying is true. Surgical strike was also launched and I don't know if that can be justified. ||| I feel like this is another example of why the police need to be better trained! It is as important as drinking water everyday to live that a cop be trained to the best of ways possible. There is no way a cop should be punching a woman in the face! I feel like a parrot repeating this over and over throughout the years but enough is enough. ||| I think anytime somebody dies because of gunfire it is terrible. This case in particular is interesting because the deaths happened at some security units. They failed to stop at the gate and were shot. I believe maybe it was a mistake on their part and this happened unfortunately. It is quite bad but these things happen.","what did you think about the article ||| its crazy the stuff that goes on in this world ||| yeah some countries are so corrupt though ||| i remember  trump throwing toilet paper rolls at the crowd in puerto rico that was so embarrasing ||| yeah wonder what was going through is head ||| what do you think can be done to help the people in haiti ||| makes sense. also find better ways rather than trucks that are easily looted by the people ||| and also not let the haitian govt get there hands on any of it they are corrupt ||| thats a great idea ||| me too very interested in the outcome ||| were lucky to live here ||| yeah makes u realize your problems are miniscule in comparison ||| bye ||| Yeah, it's so bad that they had to suffer in the war and now they have to suffer even out of war. ||| I wish there was a way we can donate directly to them. ||| I feel bad for their families as well because they're probably impacted. ||| Wow, that's awesome. Much respect to them. How did it impact your family, if it did at all? ||| Oh okay, Japan sounds cool. I really hope veterans get the help they need in the future. ||| Do you think you would ever be able to go to war ||| Definitely not. I am a chicken when it comes to that which is why i respect veterans and people serving the nation so much ||| Hopefully the veterans that make it out are able to find great jobs and live a decent life at least. ||| Health care would be a great start! ||| Agreed! Well it was nice talking to you, bye ||| It's pretty crazy what happened ||| same here the fact that we are all at risk in 2019 for these kinds of things is scary ||| Do you think there was a good response to the tragedy? ||| Yeah I agree with the response being good all things considered ||| Is he the one that said he thought muslim security personnel at the venue collaborated with the attackers? ||| Yeah, makes me wonder if the author made that up.... ||| yeah if it aint proven they shouldnt write it ||| I don't believe it said where it came from I just remember them quoting the AFP a lot ||| yeah I remember Sting  played in the first show at the Bataclan or something like that ||| yeah these old time bands can go on playing for ages ||| thats true didn't think of that hmm thats weird. I think we finished the fifteen turns good job ||| goodbye ||| I think it was a little messed up for the frontman of the band to say that he thought security collaborated with the attackers. ||| What do you think can be done to prevent these attacks in the future ||| yeah they'd probably just switch to knives ||| yeah they seem to use vans to run people over a lot ||| yeah some people are just naturally violent ||| yeah what do you think is the approrpriate punishment ||| i think death is too quick. maybe life in solitary confinement ||| I think its sad the way elephants lack good protection ||| it just goes to show money rules over all to this day ||| yeah its weird an elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not the other as well ||| these poachers never face any repercussion ||| yeah the criminal networks are really organized and fluid ||| i am sure there is a way thats a good idea actually. ||| What do you think about these governments saying the elephants damage the crops ||| Do you think the global community will step up and help? ||| One can only hope for the best. I think that's our fifteen turns good job. Bye ||| That price is only going to go up too ||| considering 140 k elephants have been killed between 2007 and 2014 it should be harder. And it is 15 turns just checked. ||| bye ||| Yeah she wasn't doing anything that makes your jaw drop. ||| Probably seeing as China would of loved some good publicity in the news. ||| Do you think women should be allowed to fly these jets? ||| I agree with that. Yu's friends say she was a positive, humb,e and nice person who loved taking care of her friends so that just makes it more disappointing. ||| Do you think there might of been something going on there seeins as she was the first female to do it? ||| Yeah something like that is what I'm thinking happened. ||| more than likely it was probably to prove a point to people that females cant do the job by the people that sabotaged the jet. ||| Regardless if true or not it is an interesting theory ||| Makes sense since the All-China Womens Federation reported that 60 million users of the Weibo site had clicked on Yu's story. ||| bye ||| Agree the fact that adults don't educate or do anything more to stop this is even more horrifying. ||| Parents are just not being parents from the looks of things ||| I think life keeps adults too busy to keep the food on the table to be honest... ||| What do you think the kids that cause the bullying should face? ||| I believe that is something they should do train them to do better since kids aren't really ready to think straight yet as I did some things I regret as a kid as well that I would no longer do as an adult. ||| I don't think its being addressed here at all although who knows. The article says in France 90 percent of the kids have access to social media which is where all the bullying goes on. Can you imagine how many kids have access here . ||| Yeah the worst that can happen back then was miniscule to now where hundreds of kids can bully a single child at one time through social media. ||| yeah I assume every country with wide internet access has this problem. ||| What would you do if one of your kids were bullied? ||| Same first thing is contact the other kids parents to see if they can talk to the other kid as I would not be able to do that. Second definitely contact the school and if all else fails the police but they would be my last resort. I'm not a parent but that is how I would do it. Changing schools for sure though. ||| yeah they won't forget the scar as long as their alive which is terrible and I do not know how that can be fixed ||| You're right therapy does work sometimes. ||| probably their parents at home not giving them enough attention ||| dont know if they can be blamed though ||| Its just a hard subject overall. I think we did 15 turns too. I enjoyed it. Bye. ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| what do you think can be about bullying ||| agree parents are at fault in letting them on social media in the first place ||| especially kids their brains arent fully developed yet and anything negative can have a big effect on them just reading it online ||| did you ever experience bullying as a child? ||| I was bullied as well but I had older brothers who would prevent it for the most part fortunately I didn't get it as bad as other kids including my friends. It happens in every school, every city, every country. ||| yep middle school is the worst kids dont think straight at that age ||| yeah I would not want to go to school sometimes what about you? ||| do those childhood memories still haunt you today? ||| Yeah sometimes I wish I could go back and stand up for myself ||| bye ||| This is so sad and should not have happened these rides should be tested more. ||| Do you think the park should face any consequences ||| I definitely think there should be a hefty fine. ||| The fact some of them were in holiday makes it depressing to hear. ||| Yeah, leaving the stress of work and then dying on vacation is crazy. ||| Yeah the girl that watched her mother die is going to need a lot of therapy I hope she gets it. ||| Visitors said the ride had been plagued with mechanical glitches earlier that day the fact they kept it running shows who they are. ||| Money really is the root of all evil. ||| I hope justice is served here. ||| Yeah it can not at all this is just terrible. I think thats fifteen turns. Bye. ||| bye ||| Yeah and the fact that the helicopter had a power failure when trying to get to them is disappointing. ||| Yeah doesn't really make me feel like they can be relied on ||| Maybe they dont have the funding youre right ||| They definitely need to be more prepared ||| They can learn a thing or two from firefighters ||| Search and Rescue just aint that known like firefighters are ||| I remember hearing Trump wanted to cut federal aid to Cali which is probably why the rescue team is so bad. ||| Yeah, politics is crazy ||| Who knows what he'll do he's out of it. I think we did 15 turns though lol. ||| All in all, search and rescue teams need to have a huge upgrade ||| Yeah they are equally as important as everyday cops. ||| Cops are more good than bad ||| they give out toys to kids at the local parks around LA all the time ||| yeah all that money is spent on the military probably which is not even that needed ||| world police that never does a succesful intervention which makes it worse ||| aren't we still in Afghanistan? lol ||| don't forget we have bases in Germany, Japan, etc for no reason. If Russia did that we'd be calling them evil. ||| yeah its quite depressing to see some people without health care and then see new fighter jets being built ||| 1st world country btw ||| yeah its not very fair how they allocate everything ||| One can only pray ||| bye ||| It's very depressing to know that suicide deaths among kids is on the rise. ||| I'm thinking bullying by other kids that can be tough on kids that have never experienced it before. ||| and with social media it only gets worse ||| yeah what was once one kid bullying another is now hundreds or even thousands joining in on it. ||| yeah its a good thing you can block them all out with a good router ||| yeah even if you dont think theyd visit them its always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion ||| do you think some blame can be placed on the parents of kids that commit suicide? ||| I agree it depends on the case. ||| a lot of parents unfortunately do disregard the signs ||| its a crime in my opinion ||| its the logical thing to do considering what the kids go through ||| bye ||| The sad part is that its Nigeria and there will be no justice for these raped women. ||| Yeah I read they were raped by camp leaders which makes it worse ||| Yeah as a man, I couldn't live with myself knowing I raped a woman. ||| Thats terrible sorry to hear about that. I have people in my family who have also been abused and it is just depressing to think about. ||| Yeah these girls live in a country with no justice or rape resources. ||| Yeah its hard to help people that don't help themselves. ||| Yeah its hard for some guys to do that ||| at least some justice was made there but then again it was in a country where justice can be made sometimes. ||| unfortunately we cant fix other countries which sucks ||| I'm assuming you know more about the subject and would know much more about this but as a man I can also sympathize with rape victims I can only imagine the feeling like no one is listening ||| yeah people think its fine if its a woman doing the raping ||| i was always scared as a catholic to go to church as a kid and would always talk my mom out of going which probably turned out to save me in the long run ||| That's cool! haha ||| man that just sucks. I dont wanna get into details but I wish more would've been done to help you out. ||| That's great to know! ||| yeah man we dont see how lucky we are to be born here ||| Its been a good talk mturk friend! I think we did more than we needed haha. Goodbye. ||| Yeah why are they even allowed to do this. ||| at least they rescued some of the animals. ||| There should be stricter rules around the world for this kinda stuff. ||| yeah man i dont know regulates the importing of animals but they need to be replaced ||| and most caged animals are smarter than we think and have feelings/emotions like we do. ||| its very sad ||| there are more good people than bad people out there though ||| i mean its understandable when you see these kinds of things happen ||| bye ||| This is a depressing thing that happened ||| I don't know if I wouldnt just not drink water at all in those conditions. ||| I would definitely starve myself in those conditions. ||| true but is it enough ||| youre right the cost of living is probably lower there than in the usa ||| some people gathered by an aquifer in the city  and filled up plastid jugs for family so that was good ||| yeah I can only imagine the taste after drinking all that dirty water ||| probably not ||| It probably is a good thing we were born here. ||| Hopefully things get better around the world. ||| Yeah at least they are taking steps towards it ||| bye ||| bye ||| for real that is the truth ||| im a man and all but do you think this would happen if females ran the world ? ||| Thats true I didn't think of that one. ||| yeah you just have to pray for victims of war ||| unfortunately thats enough for the families of the victims ||| Yeah unfortunately our hands are tied here ||| our country should help ||| we are the world police lol ||| bye ||| That is just a terrible quake that happened in New Zealand ||| I've personally experienced earthquakes and they are scary ||| being from California you get used to them but you always wonder if its the big one when they are occuring ||| yeah that seems like theyll never find a way ||| usually every year during the summer here in california ||| from my experience although im no expert i feel them during the summer mostly ||| i sure did that one did last pretty long ||| its like if your on top of a wood plank and someone under has control of the movement moving it side to side or however they want like wavy ||| the newer ones maybe i doubt the older ones would like my house was built in the 70's before i was born i doubt it would hold up ||| yeah but you cant stop nature ||| theres no earthquakes where you're from? ||| i guess in new york you just have to deal with the cold ||| i cant imagine that! i guess every place has its pros and cons ||| its been good fellow mturk friend. goodbye. ||| That was depressing to read. ||| Whats your opinion about it? ||| you're right I can't relate to it either it is probably a good thing ||| would you flee as well if you were facing what they go through at home? ||| Same here, which is why I don't understand when people tell them to fight at home and risk their kids lives. ||| what do you think can be done to solve this problem? ||| I think nothing can be done to be honest its a lost cause and that hurts to say but I don't see a solution at all. ||| we are quite lucky to have not been born there. ||| yeah just waking up every morning having running water and toothpaste is a blessing and we never think of it as anything special. other people dont know any of that. ||| yeah man its amazing how those little things are so overlooked ||| I hope things get better in those countries though. ||| Its been a good talk friend. I agreed with you on everything. goodbye ||| that was sad to read ||| do you think anything can be done to prevent these types of crashes? ||| yeah man we need some other better forms of transportation its 2019 ||| thats very true money runs everything and is the root of all evil as well ||| Yeah I drive but its something needed there in California or else you can't get around. ||| Definitely, you never know who is drunk driving or just a terrible driver. The worst drivers are around my area definitely ||| Yes, but we should't take it as something normal. Death is not a normal thing and the quicker self driving cars become frequent the better in my opinion. ||| those are some crazy statistics ||| In what way do you think they can restructure transportation? ||| something like europe would be great people bike to work and stay fit at the same time ||| bye ||| this happens a lot in relationships it seems ||| when someone does not feel good enough for the other ||| What do you think should be the maximum age difference between couples? ||| Around 12-13 years I'm thinking. Anything more is too much. ||| Well your parents are only 12 years apart it isn't that much compared to this guy who was 20 years apart from her that was too different from each other. ||| Now that I think about my sister is married to someone about 10 years apart from her I guess it is normal nowadays lol. ||| you mean when they wore the blood of each other around their necks? that was some intense stuff to read. I don't know what to think of that, just weird. ||| hollywood people are just weird, there are a lot of weirdos in that business. ||| It's a little bit of both. I'm pretty su re there a lot of pedophiles in hollywood as well, a secret ring. It's just not a place you'd want to be at. ||| Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the rumors about that were true. ||| imagine what the hollywood actors that start from childhood. Those are the ones that end up the worst.  Just look at all the stories of childhood stars and how they end up. ||| Thats true or someone like Kobe Bryant who came out of High School as well. ||| Kobe unfortunately will always be the better player and have had the better career but I see what you mean about Lebron. ||| I'm a Laker fan and can't accept Lebron as the better player sorry. ||| Game on the line , NBA finals, last shot to win the game, you choose Kobe plain and simple. The Black Mamba is the closest thing we ever saw to MJ. ||| It's something we will never agree on lol. It was the best talk I ever had in one of these hits though thanks man!! Definitely wish you the best. goodbye ||| yeah that's true it is very rare for people to do that. ||| why do you think that is? ||| yeah its just not realistic no one is perfect and can give you that fairy tale life. ||| its up to you to keep it to yourself until your head clears as well. if you still feel that way after your head clears its time to have that talk with your spouse. ||| thats a good rare marriage you have going ||| its a good thing your had a grandmother that was wise ||| going to be pretty soon ||| thanks! ||| i believe  hollywood is just full of weirods ||| i think its a little of both ||| wonder why they didnt talk about him much ||| hurts tbh ||| its been good brother. goodbye ||| i think its said anytime civilians have to go through this. what about you? ||| yeah its quite sad honestly. what do you think can be done to fix this? ||| definitely also we need to stop being the world police ||| true we have to find a middle line of helping and keeping away at the same time ||| do you think that is possible? ||| yeah definitely with social media you see people from other countries interacting with each other like they're neighbors ||| yeah people seem to care they just dont have the outlet to show it ||| yeah some people are just evil and have no other solution ||| definitely propaganda is one of the worst things ever created by man ||| hopefully things get better ||| bye ||| Its always sad when things like this happen ||| Do you think that the polulation numbers had something to do with this? ||| didn't think of that one makes snese ||| Yep, here in California seems we have wild fires every year as well. Less casualties of course but they're fires. ||| yeah, this one was a whole other type of fire ||| Some countries are just that openly corrupt. ||| its a tough subject I would just hope they found other ways to help people not starve ||| that and the effect on the youngsters when they grow up ||| wish we had the medical knowledge to know what happens to them so they see the production of the palm oil is a bad thing ||| money definitely is the root of all evil ||| and hard drugs addictions ||| so true man the worst people on earth ||| good job on the convo bro. goodbye ||| I can't imagine losing one pet let alone two. ||| thats about the only good thing ||| Do you have experience with the Red Cross? ||| thats good that those organizations are in place to help ||| yeah youre right about that ||| i cant imagine the moments before the  fire started ||| fires defnitely travel fast and silent sometimes too ||| yeah most people arent knowledgeable on those things ||| As a kid I can remember a fire starting near our apartment, at the apartments across from ours. Luckily they were able to stop it from flowing onto the next apartments. ||| i can cope losing tv's phones etc but losing memories in pictures is scary ||| bye ||| I think this is just terrible. ||| it seemed to be too short and doesnt say what the visitors do to the bears ||| yeah to me it seemed that way too ||| just another reason why the article is just not a good one ||| if journalism is that easy I think I might give it a go. ||| True gone are the days of getting the news through newspapers lol ||| yeah people dont even read the articles they just read the tweet headline and comment on it lol ||| Back to the bears I feel we as people should find ways to stop this. ||| i believe its tourists but hunters ||| I assume there is a monetary reason as to why they are doing this. Money is the root of all evil. ||| Money comes and goes, creatures like polar bears do not. bye ||| I thought it was terribly deppressing what these children had to go through ||| Yeah its just disgusting ||| What do you think should be done ||| no doubt about it. ||| i think capital punishment should be given ||| i think everyone supports that ||| she has great heart for getting involved ||| yeah thats when things started to move when she got involved ||| if she never got involved nothing wouldve happened ||| good thing it didnt go that way. its been a good talk. bye. ||| that is a sad situation ||| yeah what do you think happened the article didnt say much ||| did the article say where the parent was? ||| not really the article was missing a lot of key stuff ||| probably have power running in the orphanage for a start ||| what do you think can be done? ||| i agree ||| its too tough to think about ||| not yet but it unfortunately will happen to all of us at one point.. ||| yeah scary stuff ||| i agree with that thats a great idea ||| well it was a good talk man. bye. ||| bye ||| I think its crazy how females need consent to travel abroad in that country ||| Wow youre a female so you understand this more. As a man even I know its just not right! ||| It makes me wonder what else females cant do in that country jeez ||| Well it seems any country is better for females than Saudi Arabia. ||| It seems that international pressure is the only thing that can fix this ||| I believe sanctions would work wonders ||| It is a slippery slope I agree. That is part of their culture at the end of the day for women to be treated that way ||| yeah youre right. I guess they have every right to be that way although its odd ||| or maybe theyre forced to go against the changes ||| yeah this isnt their first rodeo lol ||| didn't they kill some guy in an embassy a few months back as well or something like that. they just are not the most trustworthy people ||| you too . bye. ||| I think we need to do better with our recycling. ||| Lazy people are the problem ||| well most cities make it easier I guess it depends where you're at. My city makes it easy ||| Yeah what I do is just collect all my beer and soda cans instead of throwing them out and every 6 months or so take them to the local recycling place and they usually pay me around 400  bucks for all the cans. Its a rare case where drinking pays off. ||| yeah cant really talk about rural areas since I've never lived there ||| I assume there must be some recycling centers though? ||| thats just terrible ||| yeah man and its nobodys fault at that point. IT would be nice to have those places out in rural areas as well. ||| I've been using a hydro flask I bought on Amazon for a year now and man its one of the best investments. Keeps my water cold the whole day and no need for water bottles. ||| do check it out. bye. ||| I think its hard to offer asylum to everyone ||| I cant think of any solution to that problem ||| The problem needs to be fixed from the root and thats in those countries ||| yeah the world has always been this way unfortunately ||| maybe so one can only hope ||| yeah man the stress must be through the roof ||| The German system has too many loopholes though that must be fixed ||| yeah countries can only hold so many people ||| very true ||| its just a crazy situation ||| its been a good talk. bye ||| What did you think about the article ||| yeah what do you think they should do? ||| I agree, Too much  people cant fit in one country. Maybe only take in the serious sad cases ||| yeah keep it minimum germany is small ||| yep way too small for all the asylum seekers ||| they should fix their own country ||| youre in the air force? ||| lol okay ||| back to the article. I think letting a few in is good, not all. ||| i doubt they would check based on religion. its germany not some southern american state loll ||| been a good talk. bye ||| I think thats a crazy death to have just flying around and running into a wind turbine ||| It makes sense since birds also run into windows from houses all the time that they would run into wind turbines ||| do you think they can do anything to prevent it ||| yeah or like a chemical sprayed around the area that birds and flying animals are digusted by and fly around because of the smell ||| yeah i agree it has to be planned out right ||| Yeah after that the deaths should lower ||| hopefully things do get better ||| yeah as technology improves so does everything else and this will be no exception ||| yeah it must be tested thorougly first ||| bye ||| That just angers me. ||| We need to do more to keep these endangered species afloat. ||| They need to find other ways to go about doing things ||| Orangutans are endangered in that province so  it tends to make people angrier than usual ||| the risk of fires would increase if sungai putry was drained and deforested so its odd they'd do all that. ||| nah, money rules all. money is the root of all evil. someone with money can do that doesnt have to be a big corporation unfortunately money is the key thing here ||| give sanctions to the country ||| what do you think should be done to stop them? ||| thats actually a good idea as well ||| yeah thats true ||| not really, have you? ||| ive seen lions at a zoo but would like to see an orangutan ||| they have great memory ||| not really do you? ||| bye ||| yeah i agree. ||| gun control is needed ||| that probably a good idea you cant go on a shooting spree with a single shot ||| common sense never gets passed into law ||| theyre not trained enough period ||| its just we now have social media and it becomes more known ||| well the only good thing is people know its a problem now at least thats the first step ||| after reading the article you cant help but feel urgency ||| no doubt about it ||| were all being trained to be slaves by the government ||| its the only conclusion ||| was a good talk. bye ||| macing elders is never good ||| im with the protestors here we already took enough of the native americans land ||| what about the protest rubbed you the wrong way? ||| yeah i didnt see them do anything wrong but the police on the other hand.. ||| riot gear to fight the tough elderly people i guess ||| yeah i wonder why ||| probably. fox news tends to overblow things ||| maybe they can learn from this as a police department ||| i feel cops need to be trained more in all states ||| most cops are great but the bad ones ruin it for the rest ||| yeah with youtube and phone cameras its tough ||| live PD is a great show. Yeah, cop body cameras are great but I feel like they can be better ||| the problem is a shot being a cops first option instead of something less lethal. esp when the suspect has no weapon ||| yeah i always wondered why theyre trained that way ||| i agree with that. its been a great talk i enjoyed it. bye ||| what do you think can be done to prevent these attacks ||| its tough I have no idea either ||| cant imagine what they went through ||| Thats true one can only hope that peace stays forever ||| can you elaborate? dont think I read about that in the article ||| if that was the reason they attacked I think one shouldnt mess with peoples religions so it was not the right thing to do. ||| yeah its like youre taunting them to do it ||| most of the time in these things innocent people die which is terrible ||| yeah it tends to happen which is bad ||| i myself believe in god but never go to church dont think its needed ||| most of the disrespectful people ive met go to church every sunday ||| thats actually a good quote bro. its been a good talk enjoyed it. bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| do you think it really happened or do you think she might be lying ||| thats true i sort of believe her because she was young when it happened ||| yeah it makes sense that its true and not a lie given that fact ||| yeah they feel like since they have some power they can get women to do whatever they want ||| yeah i wonder why they feel that way ||| what do you think can be done ||| yeah and at home from the parents ||| yeah that would help a lot ||| do you know anyone that has gone through what that woman went through ||| yeah i hear that stuff happens a ton in college ||| bye ||| i wonder what was wrong with that woman ||| yeah its obvious she has mental problems ||| yeah it happens to some people at that age which begs the question who was taking care of her ||| Surely someone will step up ||| if that was my parent none of that would matter tbh. id care for them. ||| theres people you can pay to look after them while working. caring for someone does not mean you are with them 24/7 lol ||| well I guess thats a price I'm willing to pay for my parents who took care of my annoying self as a child even though I was not always nice to them. There is more than just health care nurses out there lol. ||| trust me I'm currently caring for kids that were taken from my sister because of her mental problems. I am now taking care of them as seen by the state. I am not with them 24/7 and I find ways to look after them and make sure their homework is done on time. Even the bad child who was out until 4 am when he was under my sisters care doesn't sneak out now. I am not new to caring for people. Someone with dementia is a whole other ballgame. No one has it all figured out, its just that caring for loved ones is not that difficult. Maybe we were raised differently. ||| if you know someone you are looking after has dementia you raise you level of care. You install alarm systems, phone apps etc. The technology is there. Ofc it wont work all the time and I am not trying to discredit your points because they are valid. But you just have to step your game up according to the circumstances ||| I agree with many of your points as well its just if there is a will theres a way ||| yeah most definitely my parents are up there in age thank god they are still with me mentally. ||| Thats a scary thought bro. We have to be thankful everyday no one close to us has that disease and hope it stays that way. ||| yeah we always read about these cures but to be honest they still seem far away ||| Yeah these sites that clickbait these cures need to be removed. I can't imagine getting my hopes up if my wife had dementia only to click on it and see it was nothing. Thats playing with peoples emotions a little too much. Anyway, this has been the best talk I've had on one of these hits brother. I respect you very much for that. Hope the rest of your day goes well. bye ||| That was a sad article ||| We can probably help better those countries ||| Yeah what do you think should be done ||| i think thats a good idea ||| I think we need to just let some in not all because most countries cant handle all of that to be honest ||| also hold those accountable that are doing harm to those countries ||| yes true but what i mean by that is the dictators ||| that was a mess that guy was doing good things for that country ||| its a slippery slope ||| yeah when your kids are at risk you do anything to save them ||| its either die on a boat or die in your homeland. its a pick your poison type of situation ||| just hope for the best for them. it was a good talk. bye ||| What do you think about her death ||| yeah, did you hear about her before this article? ||| I remember her from the Elian Gonzales news back in the day ||| i think he lives in cuba now not sure ||| Fortunately no, what about you? ||| I just know you lose your memory ||| yeah I believe that happens too ||| most likely. once the first one comes through it opens the door one would think for the next generation of females. whats your opinion? ||| yeah i have no idea about politics to be honest ||| yeah I definitely vote. More likely to vote now with all that trouble going on in the white house. ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| i remember hearing about her in the news as a kid ||| that disease is terrible ||| yeah and forgetting things thats scary ||| yeah my father had a stroke a few years back and the only thing I was worried about was if he would recognize us all, thankfully he did others are not so lucky. ||| Thanks and yeah I hope they find something out or figure out ways to repair the brain ||| yeah there are some very smart people especially in the past few years ||| I agree we wake up and see our family and think nothing of it like its supposed to be this way at all times. Little do we know we are lucky to be that healthy still. ||| Yeah most people dont realize that. ||| Yeah, its just how we are naturally ||| It's been a great talk! Have a great and blessed day. bye ||| yeah I had totally forgotten about this attack as well ||| what do you think can be done to prevent these things in the future ||| countries shouldnt behave like the world police i agree ||| i just say we focus on our own problems and let them deal with their own as well ||| I can only imagine the pain they went through... ||| hopefully they receive the correct help from people trained for those types of situations ||| Yeah, for example Denys Plaud who survived because when the attackers burst in he was up on the balcony where there was more room. ||| its about being lucky and being at the right place at the right time. too many things tbh i rather just not be in that situation ||| yeah one can only wish for things to change ||| life is too short and fragile and these stories reinforce that feeling ||| bye ||| Kidnapping children is the most cowardly thing someone can do ||| Very disgusting indeed ||| probably just hurt their finances freeze all accounts instead of the usual drone strikes? But who knows they would still find ways around it ||| theyre definitely not that influential outside of that region thats for sure ||| They're programmed to believe these fighers are for their religion. If they go against them they would probably be told they are going against islam and all that talk. ||| I feel like its a lost hope in that part of the world. I don't know if its the CIA creating these groups or what, but its been going on for a while now. ||| There's a lot that goes on that we don't know ||| its tought to pull the trigger on the cause of why the groups are created ||| remember Libya. They had a pretty good dictator who had the country going well yet somehow they revolted against him and now look at that country. ||| yeah i rather be here than there thats for sure ||| i would never want to live there its too backwards. its been a good talk bro. bye ||| imagine waking up and knowing you live in that country ||| i believe its a select few that cause all of this ||| we are at the end of the day related to apes ||| which is understandable if you think about it. family comes first ||| its sad that we will probably never see that happen ||| its working with some countries so i guess that is some sort of progress. ||| its hard to imagine but  if it meant saving my family id probably do it. ||| Its a tough life out there ||| yeah it was much more humane if that can be said in the old days when it was just swords ||| one can only hope for change ||| it was a good talk. bye ||| i wonder how they managed to text everyone in eastern aleppo ||| yeah . what do you think about the whole situation ||| we are very lucky to be living here ||| what do you think should happen to them ||| yeah we are always trying to be the world police ||| yeah i totally agree with that ||| someone is definitely doing things and make it seem like it was assad ||| its like libya with gadaffi all over again ||| we probably will never know who it is though that starts these things ||| who do you think it is ||| i agree just didnt want to say lol ||| i agree theres more than just this theyve done to the world ||| its been a good talk bro. bye ||| How did you feel about the article? ||| Yeah I never heard about the rise in hate crimes against them until now. ||| what do you think is causing it now? ||| yeah that's probably it. the presidents choice of words also arent always the best ||| maybe in the future we will all get along ||| Reading over the article it does seem like its a problem that has been going on for a long time ||| yeah its hard to pin what the root of the cause is ||| probably more programs that bond people together. Educate people on these things. i honestly have no idea. what do you think can be done? ||| definitely kids are like sponges and take in what their parents teach them or anyone around them. if theyre educated in time it can be prevented ||| I agree it all starts at home with the parents. ||| i definitely agree on all points. its been a good talk. bye ||| i think its wrong to attack people for having a certain religion ||| what do you think can be done ||| yeah it starts at home with parenting ||| I feel like I have more than a few times, what about you? ||| yeah i probably would know not to react badly though because its what they would want me to do ||| I haven't really had experiences with them so I can't really say. What about you? ||| yeah I feel like the bad ones ruing it for the majority ||| yeah every race or religion or group in general has bad people in it. ||| yeah hope so ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah we need to help these kids ||| yeah wonder if they can get it ||| thats sad that they are sent to school hungry ||| cant imagine having to do that ||| yeah how could a teacher go on with class like that ||| yeah i want to look into it and figure out how to help ||| i wonder that too ||| or if they cant a foreign govt should step in ||| yeah no doubt, do you think they will? ||| hopefully it gets better ||| bye ||| wonder why he did that ||| most likely thats usually what the cause of these things is ||| i wonder what they did to him or if they did anything at all. It doesn't justify his actions they're his sons at the end of the day ||| yeah maybe they were having problems ||| whats sad is the age of his sons. 5, and 4. Too young for any of this. ||| he told her that he wasnt going to be taken alive which tells me he was thinking and was fully aware of what he did ||| yeah shes the one that tipped the cops imagine what she felt ||| probably not. what do you think ||| yeah its like if the kids are caring for themselves. ||| bye ||| im sure there is money involved or else they wouldnt care ||| yeah money is the root of all evil ||| that part made me angry ||| its crazy how nothing is ever done about this though ||| exactly. no one else to blame at that point. ||| I agree that these poachers need the money off what they kill to survive but at what cost does that have to happen ||| its hard for the usa to be the world police on everything but in cases like these i feel like its appropriate ||| what do you think the consequences should be if they were ever prosecuted ||| i agree with that it would set a example for future offenders ||| i agree ive heard of poachers who just do it as a hobby that is just insane ||| yep they are already rich and just go there many times a year for the so called \thrill\"" of poaching"" ||| oh wow i remember hearing about that ||| yeah i remember watching a youtube video about it ||| yeah, ive read so many of these articles now and boy oh boy did we ever get lucky to be born in the usa? ||| yeah while it isnt perfect what country is better? none i can think of ||| its been a great talk I agreed with you on everything. bye ||| thought theyre on the wrong side for siding with the poachers ||| yes but also I see things from their perspective I' ||| yep the villagers probably profit financially from the poaching and they are poor so it helps ||| yeah I dont blame them ||| yeah they went too crazy there ||| that explains how they reacted to this ||| that will be interesting to see ||| do you think this will continue ||| one can only hope it gets better ||| bye ||| Imagine going out of your way to help the  people in need and it turns out you end up dead. That is terrible. ||| i can only imagine what their loved ones are going through. They would not have expected this in a million years. ||| what do you think is their reasoning behind the attacks? ||| at least hopefully they realize there is better ways to get that point across ||| probably something like that is what they would say. there is no way they would admit to doing it on purpose honestly ||| yeah we need to stop trying to be the world police ||| yeah it would be best to focus on our own problems ||| yeah let the organizations help and let their leaders fix their problems ||| they would definitely need some sort of security in these dangerous places ||| I definitely agree with that. It's been a good talk. bye ||| what do you think should be done? ||| the ones that do go to your doorstep should be sent back and apply at the embassy of the country they want to live in, or something like that ||| Exactly. Listen I'm all for being tolerant but we have a lot of problems at home already we can't just let everyone in. Can you imagine that. ||| Yeah we have no problem helping other countries get better. We should just focus on making their countries better. ||| I'm guessing Africa? I know Africa has many many African immigrants. I watch a lot of soccer and most of the French players are of African ancestry, also watched a few docs about that situation. ||| pressure from the people that are fed up probablyh ||| Yeah, it seems the governments have an interest in letting this happen all across Europe though. Heck, even in our own southern border we've been getting African immigrants. It seems people from Mexico don't even cross to the US anymore it's all central american and african immigrants. I wonder who's sending them. ||| yeah it seems like technology makes it easier for these people to come together ||| they watch TV and see these first world countries living big and want to live that way. ||| if the world was borderless we'd be like the wild wild west all over again. ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article ||| its crazy how people let this happen ||| do you think anything can be done at this point ||| i cant speak for t he french but i wouldnt want so many immigrants maybe a few but not that many ||| Another thing is, everyone expects America to help in these kinds of situations and its time they help themselves and we look after our own first ||| yeah the central american immigrants just cross across mexico and the usa and blame those countries for not allowing them to cross ||| well it used to be Mexicans in the 80's, they don't cross anymore now its countries like Honduras and El Salvador crossing. ||| back to the topic. I hope these kids get help ||| yeah kids are innocent and dont think for themselves ||| unfortunately we can't really do much from over here ||| true amen to that ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article ||| yeah I cant imagine the pain of that mother ||| id do whatever it takes to get them out of there as a father ||| all this just makes me feel grateful for living in America ||| same here its too crazy out there ||| yeah it has its faults but youre much better off here than elsewhere ||| yeah the fact that water is necessary for life makes it scary that youd be forced to gulp that dirty water down ||| id give up my food to my children in that position and id be the malnourished one but its tough ||| yeah thats just terrible to read ||| yeah man just ruins your mood lol ||| thanks man its been a good talk i enjoyed it. bye ||| i think no humans should struggle with starvation like they are ||| yeah 2019 and it feels like Nigeria is from the year 1419 ||| yeah literally no options the government is too corrupt beyond repair there ||| yeah I think they're up there with the worst countries ||| yep they make usa look like paradise ||| one in a billion chance and we made it. ||| yeah man even people on minimum wage live like kings compared to the average nigerian or venezuelan. ||| yeah we are not perfect but much better off than these nations with ton of problems ||| yeah north korea is crazy bad. ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| Yeah, quite scary 70 year olds deal with that. ||| yeah it is definitely depressing to read ||| no, do you? ||| whats their situation? are they in america or syria still ||| thats tough to worry about your family in Syria like he/she probably does ||| wow you would think he would be anti assad. well according to the media assad is a bad person but i dont know i cant judge if im not there ||| i wouldnt doubt that tbh ||| that is crazy ||| its understandable since he was born and raised there to feel patriotic about it ||| its crazy what bad humans can do in this world ||| what do you mean? ||| bye ||| i think the owner should be charged ||| Man imagine the last moments struggling to be cool under all that heat ||| yeah this definitely isnt the first case ive read of this! ||| imagine being that arrogant to believe nothing will happen to a living person or animal if you leave them in a hot car ||| jesus thats just terrible. someone could actually want to kill their child because of whatever reason and just leave them in a hot car and they know the police would turn it to a simple accident! how crazy is that ||| so crazy its hard to believe that its real life sometimes with these laws ||| they are already psychopaths probably tbh ||| yeah and with social media a racist rant or a violent killing is caputred on video and posted within seconds ||| exactly. will you or do you let your kids use social media? ||| that is a great way to do it. I will be doing the same its the only way to go. ||| yeah I personally have a niece who cut her wrists because she was bullied online. She no longer is allowed to have a phone because of that. My sister messed up letting her use the phone in the first place. ||| Kids just cant handle it at that age it becomes too much. I'm definitely taking your advice when my kids are of age and give them a flip phone. Better to be safe than sorry with social media! Its been a great talk. Have a great day! bye ||| It was pretty interesting to read that. What do you think? ||| I think I read that too. Its hard to understand that part. Why do you think he was there ||| It seems a lot of people just shoot animals for fun nowadays. ||| Thats interesting to learn didn't know wolf meat is something you can't eat. You learn something new everyday. ||| Deer meat seems like it would be tasty to be honest although I've never had it. What do you think about hunting overall? ||| yeah like the millionaire poachers who just go to Africa to kill Lions and other animals for the thrill of it. They are already rich and do it as a hobby. Thats terrible. ||| yeah like that doctor that posted that picture of the animal he killed a whlle back. Thats sickening ||| Yeah I think I saw it on the news. What do you think should be done about those type of people ||| I think creating laws that go against that type of behavior is the first step the problem is money talks and these rich poachers would try their hardest to stop it. ||| bye ||| That is depressing how was this man not a citizen yet. Something is wrong with our laws. ||| It seems like a joke to be honest hard to believe that there is no law in place to prevent that. ||| there are far too many stories like this to be honest way too much ||| Actually a few months back I remember reading about a New York man with Diabetes being deported back to the middle east even though he only spoke english and he ended up dying there on the streets with no health care for his diabetes ||| yeah it was quite depressing i believe there was a video showing him in the middle east crying and begging to be brought back. Unfortunately it never happened. Hopefully the laws change. I understand we cant take in criminals but what about the ones that never committed a crime and have worked and been here forever. ||| Agree with you on that this country was once all about fighting for a good cause. ||| Yeah I agree on that one! ||| work here ten years paying taxes and no big crimes. I understand running a red light isnt a deal killer. ||| well there should be a quota as well to prevent too many people from coming in ||| yeah there is no other choice in my opinion ||| bye ||| yep reminds me of the vets that served our forces getting deportes back to mexico for a DUI they did in the past. Doesn't change the fact they fought for our country more than the regular American ever  did. We need to stop deporting people that are not deserving of it and only deport the bad illegals like the ones that commit actual crimes. ||| our laws seem so backwards sometimes ||| this man should be in america not south korea ||| hopefully it works out ||| this isnt the first of these stories i heard. One guy with a brooklying accent was deported back to his grandparents country. he died on the streets in that country because he couldnt take care of his diabetes there ||| yeah its quite sad how often this happens. ||| wowww that is crazy! our health care is definitely not the best ||| so inept these people are one wonders how they were elected ||| illegals do seem to get away with a lot ||| yep its that time we take care of all the homeless in the streets that need help first ||| or skid row! been a great talk i enjoyed it. bye ||| yeah good thing there was still blood at the scene as evidence ||| yeah wonder what makes people do this ||| yeah they have nothing to lose ||| do you think anything can be done to prevent these things ||| i think its the consequences of being evolved from apes. we are related to them at the end of the day ||| yep that explains all the wars and bad things in the world ||| yeah its crazy ||| hope something changes soon ||| honestly im at a loss i would say probably stronger consequences ? just being sentenced to life doesnt seem very intimidating for already crazy people ||| bye ||| its sad how long shes been held captive ||| yeah 30 years imagine that ||| i hate reading about these things ||| yeah way too common ||| who oversees these things is my question ||| crazy how they probably live in luxury too ||| and its also crazy that their license gets approved every year to keep her ||| money talks most likely ||| yeah you would think this was going on in a 3rd world country but not here ||| yeah its sad when you realize it  will probably never change ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah anytime children are hurt it breaks my heart ||| yeah they did not have a chance at living life ||| agreed makes you wonder ||| yeah and now the family is left to deal with that on top of losing them. ||| i wonder what energy he would have left after all this ||| i dont even think id want to keep living tbh ||| thats very true ||| I'm sorry about your loss. Must be terrible. i feel like my sister is headed that route with all her troubles and ive just been preparing mentally for the day. ||| thanks and yeah when a father dies its a whole different feeling ||| bye ||| what did you think about kenya deporting that official ||| why do you think it was a good decision ||| but they have 1,000 troops in Sudan so they are not focusing on their own ||| and they basically deported that opposition member to his death seeing as he was part of the group trying to remove the government ||| what ethnicity are you ||| and you hate africans? ||| You live in America. I doubt you know them ||| Why do you dislike Africans? I've never been there ||| Ive never been or know anything about Africa. ||| Like I said. I would need to live there or visit to get a grasp on it. I'm not going to base my opinion on the news which is always full of lies and President Cheeto Mctwitter fingers speaking 24/7 ||| Exactly. Except this one talks like he runs things when he doesn't run anything lol ||| Why waste your time voting. I rather do something else at voting time. Presidents dont run anything anyway. The bankers do. ||| we live in denial and think our voice is heard when it aint ||| its been a good talk. bye ||| i think theyre correct in what theyre doing with the smoking what about you ||| yeah ive always wondered why it was allowed near children ||| yeah nothing worse than breathing that in ||| yeah its the only solution in my opinion ||| probably just hardcore smokers that depend on smoking to live ||| yeah that is too selfish ||| yeah theyll have their spots to smoke in ||| hopefully this stops people from wanting to start smoking ||| yeah that would be amazing to see ||| yeah ive noticed that too ||| you too!. bye ||| I think its at least a good sign that they are trying to find a solution. ||| Agreed that we take it for granted here, to have some people hate vaccines like they do ||| have you heard about the re-emerging diseases because people arent taking vaccines ||| jesus you would think once her kid got that whooping cough she'd realize maybe the vaccines aren't so bad after all. People like that ruin it for the rest of us. ||| its fine I like to hear stories like that lol. Also, I feel like when the Haitian government said no to distributing vaccines, that was just terrible to read. ||| I think the people that want small government go to the extremes though. They want basically no government and that would be hard to live without. ||| Oh man I still don't know how Trump got elected... ||| Why am I not surprised that someone anti-vax is a Trump supporter haha. And yeah, it seems to me that a lot of these organizations don't have the power they should have in these situations. ||| Yeah hopefully they can get this mess sorted out. And yeah should we end it now? It's been a good talk by the way enjoyed it! ||| Couldn't imagine being a parent and not having proper healthcare access  for them ||| have a great day. bye ||| i thought its embarrasing how an agreement can't be reached on whether the vaccines are effective or not ||| yeah the egos are through the roof in that article ||| it explains why many problems in the world are still unsolved ||| yeah its a me or them mentality ||| do you see any signs of this changing in the future? ||| yeah much like all other problems in the world it will most likely stay the same ||| yeah it takes death for people to show emotions for a day or two max ||| yep back to their real self after that ||| money is the root of it ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article ||| I agree its quite crazy ||| goes to show we need better gun laws ||| yeah there needs to be stronger background checks for these lunatics out there ||| yeah thats the saddest part ||| imagine being stuck on a plane like that ||| i would probably look for a way out but there is no way out of a plane like that ||| yeah i would probably try and stay quiet to not attract attention ||| they have to at this point ||| probably a mental disorder ||| it could be that too ||| it was a good talk i enjoyed it. bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah those security personnel need to be dealt with for that ||| woww that is so crazy ||| Agreed. Also they're designed for hunting animals I believe as well. ||| unfortunately those people probably dont think that ||| Didn't know much about that. Were  they once together? ||| Ahh. Didn't know about that. Yes splitting countries is never good, sort of like  Korea. ||| yeah that usually results in disaster ||| She did want to become a doctor so I doubt she would be out causing trouble for no reason. ||| thats quite depressing ||| it seems us humans have been violent as far back as the history books say ||| Agreed on that. It's been a good talk bro. bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah can't believe someone would think pellet guns do no harm to shoot them freely like that ||| Its a good thing too that she's trying to stay positive and greets every guest coming to see about her health with a smile. ||| Yeah shes a good girl who had a good future ||| makes you glad to live in the usa ||| yeah it might not be a perfect country but much better than those ||| hope so but it seems tough from what the article says ||| hopefully she finds all the answers she needs ||| do you think things will change in that country ||| yeah corruption seems to always be around ||| bye ||| Well I feel like its depressing that the reporter that tried reporting on this got fired. ||| Yeah. All for trying to give a voice to the raped women. ||| Yep it said there are about 1 million Rohingya Muslims in Burma who are stateless ||| imagine the diseases going around the area its frightening ||| You would think the UN or someone would reach in and help them out ||| yeah I remember reading that just seems there should be more help ||| Hopefully this changes soon and they get some help ||| Corrupt government most likely. There has to be some money involved ||| do you think they can change things around in that country? ||| Some countries are just too backwards ||| Agreed. It's been a good talk regardless. bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah I feel like the US needs to do a better job of investigating who it supports before supporting them ||| it should be good because it would prevent the US from supporting the wrong people. ||| yeah imagine dying like that. thats scary ||| agreed. We are lucky to live in this country. ||| do you think they will do something to stop these attacks ||| Same. I think its just out of control at this point. ||| It feels like its been this way ever since humans have been around. ||| Yep. But then again we evolved from apes so it sort of makes sense. ||| yeah that would be interesting to know ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah the fact that eight people suffered minor injuries only is amazing ||| imagine the memories of people they no longer have with them like a grandparent being burned away in front of you like that. ||| yeah the article was too short for my liking ||| yeah seems like I wrote that article and not a professional ||| yeah what I feel like is that journalist should have been at the scene asking questions to get a good picture of what really happened , they probably dont do it like that anymore though and just get information from other sources ||| yeah me and you can both be journalists nowadays. dont get me wrong its still tough work but it seems easier than the old days when they had to go out and get the news and not get it from the information from another site. i also dont follow the news anymore its a shame what has happened to media ||| agreed about social media. has brought bad things more so than good. Everyone is just trying to get the most likes or retweets and at the end of the day that gets us nowhere. We have devolved instead of evolved like other species do. ||| yeah so many children committing suicide because the kids at school make fun of them online because of the clothes they wear to school, or how their body is shaped. It's crazy ||| reading through the article again it seems that this complex probably lacked a good plan for these types of tragedies ||| yeah. it was a good talk by the way. bye ||| yeah that was terrible to read, what do you think can be done to prevent these accidents? ||| yeah saving money can cause these things to happen ||| Imagine the family members of the victims finding this out ||| you're right I'd rather know than be up all night worrying ||| wow never heard about that, that really is depressing :( ||| sometimes you have to boost the morale of the workers I guess. I'd probably do the same :(. ||| yeah when you have hope you stay sane ||| Ima have to look that up thats interesting. ||| Also the fact that they overlook maintenance ||| well i think theyre known for lower quality products as well. Judging by this article it seems like their coal mines as well. ||| Money really is the root of all evil ||| Well its been a good talk I enjoyed it very much! bye ||| I thought the fact that he faces 14 felony counts only is not enough ||| Also reading through the article another woman described to police a similar scenario in 2016 which means he isnt new to this ||| yeah i agree with that ||| what do you think can be done to prevent these things ||| its definitely a tough task to think of ||| its tough being a woman ||| do you know anyone that has suffered this ||| i personally dont either ||| agree society is all sorts of messed up ||| agreed. bye ||| I think some people just shouldn't be parents, what about you? ||| imagine leaving pills on the floor while being a parent with kids in the house ||| even just drugging my own child I would never forgive myself! ||| I think so, what do you think? ||| yeah cps needs to do a better job out there ||| yeah it starts at home with parents and when parents arent any good who else is there to save them ||| yeah it was an accident only ||| if i was the parent here i would probably be tracing back my steps to see where i dropped the pill and make sure it never happens again. you? ||| yeah i would always have it on the back of my mind ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| Exactly. Imagine having that cold of a heart that you kill a harmless animal in that manner. ||| I think its a real story. Witnesses said that he picked up a different flamingo but put it down before getting the other one. ||| it was probably smaller ||| pinky was already 19 years old thats sad ||| no idea either ||| he needs a fine and jail time in prison ||| yep and those prisons have people that are unfairly in prison. i think you mean we need a better justice system. ||| yeah i believe so ||| yep happens everyday in america unfotunately. some people make money off having full prisons ||| bye ||| Yeah, we need to do better in protecting these animals. ||| I think educating people on the consequences but at this point I don't know what can be done to be honest. What about you? ||| What do you think might of caused the river to go dry? ||| I think they should build more artifical canals and stuff like that if possible. ||| I think the article said that was being done in some countries ||| no idea, why do you think they haven't done it yet? ||| Most likely. Paraguay isn't the richest country ||| yep I've heard about Paraguay when their team is participating in a world cup ||| yeah never hear anything about them lol ||| yeah i dont even know who their president is or if they have one. but back to the article, I hope things change and they find a way to save these animals ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| Yeah I didnt even know the troops were still in Afghanistan ||| yeah that is depressing ||| seems like it will never end ||| Agree, its crazy that they dont pack up and head elsewhere. Then again, most people can't. ||| what do you think can be done to stop this conflict? ||| Yeah both sides must work together to end all of this once and for all ||| Yep hope so ||| That seems so impossible to achieve. ||| as a kid I remember watching the news about this and to think its still going on is so crazy. ||| agreed on everything. good chat. bye ||| I agree . Astonishing that leprosy still affectrs 385,000 people around the world still. ||| The media seems to always mislead us ||| not really, do you? ||| what's wrong with armadillos? I'm clueless about them. ||| According to the article. there is no evidence of squirrel to human transmission so thats a good thing ||| It's crazy how Leprosy has been known since biblical times lol ||| did not know that. ||| you really have to take care of yourself with all these diseases going around. ||| not really. I have family members with diabetes and high blood pressure that's the most. what about you? ||| bye ||| Yeah I remember hearing stories about them fighting a long time ago. ||| Do you think India should face consequences for what they did? ||| Pakistan is definitely known for taking good care of terrorists. ||| Wasn't Osama Bin Laden also there in a mansion. ||| do you think there will be another was between the two? ||| I wouldn't doubt anything anymore to be honest after seeing somebody like Donald Trump getting elected. ||| Everyone knows the dangers of nuclear power . Before all they had was airstrikes and guns. ||| lol that made me laugh went from serious to comedy real quick ||| True USA is the king of social media stuff. ||| yeah that makes sense. We are very lucky to be living here to be honest. ||| bye ||| hey what did you think about the article ||| Yes imagine having that cold of a heart to do this? So disgusting. ||| seriously must be someone with issues beyond belief. ||| imagine the pain!?!? ||| exactly. its crazy some of these people live among us. ||| They probably don't even have enough of a brain to call what they think of a mindset. ||| they would probably do it again if they could. ||| yes people just have not found out most likely. ||| that article is something i wont forget ||| ugh agreed it ruined my mood to read that ||| agreed. hope they find the culprits soon. ||| yeah which is why i doubt they will ||| it was a great talk overall. bye ||| what did you think about the article? I thought the cop was wrong in this. ||| She was saying the issue was resolved, so by that I guess she called for help but no longer needed it? Not sure! ||| Yeah its weird how the law works for some and not for others. If she tells you the issue is resolved one would think that's the cue to move on to the next call. ||| Seems to me like cops are undertrained. Anybody can be a cop and it shouldn't be that way. ||| wow thats crazy to watch ||| the kids will never forget that image as long as theyre alive ||| Thats a tough one...what do you feel? ||| I know most cops are good definitely. It's just when these things happen it buries all the good and brings all the bad to the forefront. ||| we need to find a way to monitor them as they have guns and the majority of citizens do not. ||| yes thats what I think, do you? ||| Yes quality over quantity ||| was a good chat. bye ||| i think cops need to be better trained! ||| yeah pretty crazy how this hasnt changed ||| yeah someone needs to give therapy to these cops so they dont let their anger out on civilians ||| yeah a lot of jobs have that cant believe cops of all jobs dont ||| yeah a lot of pressure and danger they face every single day ||| its like the government thinks of them as robots who dont snap under all the pressure ||| yeah hopefully they wake up soon enough ||| yeah seems impossible ||| definitely agree ||| bye ||| i thought it was an accident after reading the article through. what about you? ||| yeah unfortunately maybe the military trainers didn't see or realize they had  to stop the vehicle. ||| yeah i wonder why they didnt realize they had to stop though. you would think they go through extensive training ||| yeah or maps detailing stops and all of that ||| thats crazy.. ||| makes you wonder if they knew but didnt stop on purpose ||| im thinking they were probably rogue ||| hopefully things become clearer ||| wish they cleared things up more at the end of the article ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| Yeah, I can definitely see why they were angry ||| Yeah a lot of them survived nazi Germany and know firsthand ||| most likely on the blue side ||| i know a few but not much, you? ||| Do you support the current President? ||| same. I don't think hes even a decent president ||| I like Yang for his policies. ||| Yeah, it starts with getting the current president impeached soon. ||| Agree! ||| bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah its the same spot a crash happened in 2013 as well. ||| at least only four died couldve been worse ||| I always wonder though if someone was inept at their job when these things happen ||| I remember about a train crash in Japan where the driver was just so scared of losing his job because his bosses were so strict and yelled at them for anything that he lost control of a train and many people died. ||| yeah its sad ||| robots should do a better job hopefully ||| lives will be saved which is great imo ||| lol man thats crazy to think about ||| did those people even go in? or were they just at the entrance of area 51 ||| imagine actually rushing in area 51 lol. expect bullets on every inch of your body ||| its been a good talk. bye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| yeah you can say that again. do you throw out your food? ||| yep i usually throw out bread which molds so quick ||| from the local grocery store ||| regular what about you ||| i usually do that too. ive been eating less fast food ||| yeah fast food is alright but not everyday ||| probably give some of the extra food away to people in need ||| yeah ive heard some that do ||| if im hungry and cant afford actual food why not. what about you ||| bye"
p025,"I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.  ||| I just read this horrifying article. I am actually not sure that I should even tell you about it because it was so disturbing. It was about this woman who was on the Dr. Phil show. When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it. I do not believe her for a second.I would rather die than hurt my kid ||| I just read an article about lead levels in water. I had thought that the water crisis in Flint was just some one off incident. It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon. ","Hello ||| Good, how are you? ||| Yeah I have to agree. Stories about suicide are always sad. ||| Yeha. Even more than that she was at the recovery center and they let her go. ||| Yea it really shows that anybody can be affected by depression. It doesn't mather how much money you have. ||| I agree. Do you think the doctors that let her go should face any consequences? ||| I think they should do a thorough investigation with the possibility of revoking the doctors license to practice. ||| Yeah people deserve to be protected from this happening again. ||| It is just really sad. ||| I dunno. Maybe she was extremely hard on herself. ||| The way she ended it is also pretty crazy. ||| Yeah just walking into the ocean. ||| Yeah it is wierd for me to think about because I do not know what is going through their minds before they do it. I have never even thought about doing it so it is hard to understand. ||| Yeah you have to think about how much damage you will do. ||| Well I think we have done enough turns. Was a good little conversation. ||| goodbye ||| Hello ||| I thought it was horrifying. What did you think? ||| Yea it is crazy that those kind of people exist.  I feel so bad for the girl. ||| Yeah something like that has to stay with you forever. ||| In the article it said that they got 20 years for it. ||| Yeah I think they should have got life too. It happened in 1996 so they are already out of prison. ||| They had the mother and daughter on the Dr. Phil show together. ||| I would absolutely never forgive them. I would want to kill them or at the very least never see or talk tot them again. ||| Haha yeah I wouldn't actually kill them but I would want to. What do you think about the mother saying that she regrets it and sorry? ||| Yeah I agree. It makes me wonder why she even agreed to see her mother on the show? Maybe she just wanted some answers. ||| goodbye ||| I agree. ||| Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. It is crazy that only 3% faced any sort of repercussions. ||| So true. I was thinking that the government needs to set up some sort of national task force or something similar. ||| Yeah and all of the de-regulation. Not to mention that the head of the EPA is a stooge. ||| I think that will surely be true in a lot of places. However certain states have their own rules when it comes to water and they are better than others. As a whole the situation is going to get a lot worse unless something is done. ||| It is unacceptable. Unfortunately I don't see anything changing unless there is a new President who supports the EPA in 2020. ||| It is true that those things happened while Obama was in office. I just don't see how anything can be done when Andrew Wheeler is the man in charge of the EPA. ||| I am as well. This article did not even mention PFAS. Have you heard of it? ||| Substances which are used in firefighting foam and a variety of nonstick, cleaning, packaging and other household products, have been linked to thyroid disease and kidney, liver, pancreatic and testicular cancer. They get into the water supply at dangerous levels. ||| Yeah that and lobbyists. I hate that lobbyists are allowed to operate how they do. ||| Yeah the Citizens United decision did so much harm to our country I think. ||| I honestly never really paid attention to politics until 2016. It is very hard to know what is true and what is not true when it is not illegal to lie to the American people.(as long as you are not under oath.) ||| Yup lies and fake promises tot he people while making backroom deals with corporations and lobbyists. ||| Yup nice talking with you. Bye ||| bye"
p026,"I just read this article about a train crash. They don't know what caused it, but several people were killed and many more were injured. There was an interview with one of the people on the train and they said that the train started to rock back and forth and it wouldn't stop. That must have been terrifying. It makes me not want to travel by train, even though I now these types of events are rare. I wish there were better regulations about transportation safety.","It sounded like a bit of a scary experience for the people on the train. ||| I wish they knew what caused it. The article said it may have hit the edge of a bridge? How does that even happen? ||| It seems like there should be more procedures in place for checking transportation safety. Maybe just a safety train that runs the track once a day to check there aren't any bridges sticking out. ||| It makes me a bit apprehensive about taking transit like that, and I was already a little wary of it. ||| Have you ever been involved in a transportation accident like that? ||| I haven't either, though one time I was on a city bus and it took a turn too sharp and hit a light pole. It was the most boring accident ever. ||| Another bus came and everyone just transferred over like nothing happened. ||| Yep. Trains are weird things though, with the tracks and all. It seems like things have to be pretty exact for everything to go smoothly. ||| I'm sure they probably will. They probably need the investigation for insurance purposes. ||| Really, I think trains are one of the safer ways to travel. I don't know the exact statistics right now, but I think they were right after planes in safeness. ||| Maybe convert them all to MagLev trains. I haven't heard anything about those crashing. ||| They kind of float on magnets, so there's very little friction. I think there's a high speed MagLev train in Japan, but I could be wrong. I know it's high speed but I'm not sure of the type. ||| Just looked it up. 375 mph. ||| The wikipedia article on Japan's high speed trains says there has never been a fatality. ||| It would take a large investment to switch, but I think it would be worth it. ||| bye!"
p027,"So sad about all the birds that die in wind turbines. It seems that every move you make, every footstep is to the detriment of something else, even if you're trying to do something good. It's so sad how violent and chaotic and painful life is. You can't walk without out killing a bug under your feet, every step is death. It makes it all so so worthless sometimes. Have a great day. ||| Another case of displacing natural wildlife to make room for our own causes and concerns. Everything we have come oat the expense of other creatures and stuff. It's difficult to look past this, and it should be even harder. I think about their lives, they see and feel and are frightened just like i am, but wha they want doesn't matter because it doesn't make anyone rich to care about others. have a great day! ||| I feel absolute fear thinking about how police are just these over militarized, under trained, fearful reactionary simpletons gunning down anyone that might even be a potential maybe threat at some point, but mostly not even that. These people are being absolutely slaughtered in the streets, and its no consequences for the cops. Sad, troubling times ||| This was an awful tragedy. You see it so much these days, it just doesn't register. Atually, i can't believe it but I'd forgotten al about it until i was reminded by this article. So tragic so sad. And it doesn't end. It just piles up nd up the more you live. Senselessand cruel. All for an ideology. All for hatred. Wha5t did those people do? Nothing. No one deserves this. ||| Just a bad situation here. A woman brings her dog or dogs to a park where their not supposed to be, takes them are their leash which you shouldn't do, bu a guy got scared and because its the wild west you can just walk around with a gun shooting things. I don't like any part of any of this. Hart to tell what to think sometimes. You don't to look for blame, but Like i said, I don't like anybody involved in tis too much","man, what an article. About the birds, right? ||| wonder what, friend? ||| everything we do harms somehting. Like a bunch of Godzillas crushing everything, indiferrently. If you want to walk ten paes, you have to crush a dozen living things under your stupid feet ||| i have seen these things. They don't seem to be filled with the corpses of dead birds, though. ||| yes. its troublesome that everything we do, we kill some natural, simple thing. It's not u to me, though, but I guess just by having electricity or whatever I'm complicit. ||| well, we're definetly not trying to help the earth, or if we are, its for our own benifit and no one elses, just so we can keep living ||| its troubling. what does life even mean if it can just be wasted, used up on wind turbines or pollution, or green energy, or land deveopment. Just being alive doesn't seem to be worth so much, if it ever was. ||| but its us, too. you and me, right now, benifiting form all of it. If you could have the choice between a life of air conditioning, or a living bird, what would you do? We've all already made that choice. ||| bird would do it to us if they got the chance. If they could have shelter and protection a our expense, they wouldn't care. Life is just so cruel and selfish. ||| or a signal that makes birds avoid it, something only they can hear, but the point isn't about the birds ||| its a grain of sand on a beach of utter inhumanity ||| we can't. i'm running out of tie. bye? ||| man, that was more than an article. Like several mashed together, but. It really makes you empathetic, don't you think? ||| people are ddying in the streets. Being slaughtered. Sad is that so many people like it this way. ||| my solution: all handguns are illegal. You can own two guns by law, eithe a single shot rifle, or a single shot shotgun. No more than those weapons, and only one of each. that's my gun control. will you support it if i write it in a bill? ||| its too common sense, though. it would never work ||| no. all cops should not have guns either. they ahould be trained tode escalate stuff. not just shoot. people like it htough. they like innocent peoplebeing killed they watch too much tv ||| and this stuff has been going on forever. its just not being reported. ||| yeah. people have power, but its just more surveilance. its like they tricked us into being walking video amerasso we have no privacy, anyone can moniter anyone anymore. i just wished the innocent black kids and adults wouldn't have to get blown away by rednecks ||| yes. i'm somewhat hopeful. but we're so complacent in usa. we know more about it, but the system is so ingrained, its hard to overcome ||| urgency, and also emotions. for the slain. the impoverished, and the bullied. ||| crazy low IQ militarized force, no consequences for what they do. itsgetting to be more and more militarized. We're losing the battle for our own rights ||| hell, yeah, brother. you know whats up ||| is that ten turns yet? ||| bye ||| I thought about this in a while. Really makes you think about all the tragedies that newer stuff just pushes out of the way ||| i thnk that we're just bombarded with new information about everything that it just becomes a list ofstuff that's horrible after a while ||| callus is right. The more we go on learning of this stuff, it builds up like a callus, or it eats so far into you. bad to say, but it feels like if a certain number of people don't get murdered, then its not worth my attention. that's horrible ||| yeah. i didn't even consider that. they were there to see them. the reason for showing up. Damn. ||| stuff gets taken advantage of. People's lives get turned into politcal tools by the charasmatic sociopaths who govern us. Its in a lot of people's interest to drive us apart. It's like in in prince machevelia or somehting. ||| boston bombing. somehting like that. It gets scary to see the reaction of militarized force to thos ehtings. I don't want to live in a country like that. But I don't know about being due, I don't think this stuff happens a lot of the time, and when it does it isn't preventable even more of the time, it's just the response the draconia militarization that comes aftwerward creating the illusion of safety ||| people seem so eager to lose that freedom if you pretend they're safe. Terrorism in america, when we're not talking about mass shooters is nearly nonexistent, but we still need tanks in the street for some reason. ||| exactly. But fear is a great manipulator. People are taken advantage of, told constantly that they're going to be in danger so they can watch more tv, or buy whatever, or vote a certain way, and it just creates chaos. ||| its hard for a lot of people, i understand that. You get like postive rewards, doepamine or whatever in a constant rush by seeing whats on your phone. It all goes hand in hand, tools of addiction, manipulation, fear. You don't want to trust anyone, everyone's a serial killer, or a rapist pedophile, or a terrorist, and if you talk about love or empathy, or trust, you're a weak retard who lives in a fantasy world. I can change myself, but by and large this is the way people are being shaped as a whole. I feel despondent or whatever. ||| i thinkthat's true ||| this is a good chat, but we're in too deep and my repoies are taking up too much time. You seem like a classy individual, thought. bye ||| man, what an article. I mean, really. ||| was it shot in front of you? ||| A close friend was murdered. But it wasn't in front of me. lol. ||| I thank God every day. ||| yeah. Keep your dog on a leash. Being a pet owner is responsibility. But also, it's so stupid people can just walk around strapped like its the wild west, looking to blow something away. ||| I don't want to do that because I'm a good person. I don't have a lot of concern for dead animals though. They're basically replacable. Disposable. I'm sure the woman felt bad for a week, maybe, then got a cool new puppy. ||| Yeah. I guess? ? That guy that shot the dog, though. I feel the worst for him. He's definetly going to shoot a family member or friend by accident. ||| Sorry he's such a friend moron he goes around armed. Sad for the person he's going to maim or kill. No winners here. ||| Sounds like a person going through the motions of saying somehting they don't mean, ust to be polite or whatever. ||| She was for sure afraid of this clint eastwood wannabe putting some holes in her. She's probably gonna have therapy after seeing that. Or maybe she doesn't even mind anymore,. what do i know? ||| I think getting mad is a normal reaction. If you can blame someone for somehting, then its like it takes the burden off of you somehow, it's like you don't have to be in control, or take resposibility if you can just blame it all on someone else, even if it was there fault or whatever. ||| if you're not a in control, take charge type, you can just say look at what you did, you did something wrong, you fix it. You pay for it, because its beyond my control. ||| Right on brother, keep on trucking. lol bye"
p028,"Reading about the attack on Paris that happened years ago brought up a lot of bad feelings and thoughts. I had completely forgotton about it because of how often things like that happen. It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace ||| Have you heard of the current situation with the amphibian population of the UK. They are being affected by a type of virus right now that is causing much of their population to be wiped out. It is terrible and is likely being caused by human intervention. At least to the point that people are causing the virus to spread faster by them constantly moving the animals and man made ponds being built. I hope the scientific community steps in to correct the issue or many more animals will be harmed. ||| Did you read into at all about the attack in paris? It is absolutely hearbreaking everything that occured and really makes me upset about the current climate of the world. I have always though that people aren't just good or evil but reading about that terrorist attack really made me think otherwise. It is absolutely sickening and i can't believe that someone could do that to another person or group of people. Something needs to be done about terrorism but what can we do without just creating more terrorists. ||| Have you been reading about what is happening in Iraq, militants taking control of villages and just rounding up thousands of them for executions. It is absolutely horrible and disgusting that people are capable of doing something like that to each other and seeing each other as less than human. Over 5000 people kidnapped it really makes me feel for their families and hope that change occurs over there. ||| Have you heard what has been happening to anti poaching rangers in africa. Some of them who have been trying to do their job and ensure the safety of the endangered animals are  being attacked and boxed in by mobs when they try to aprehend poachers. It is a shame how corrupt the local governments are within the continent that allow poaching. ||| Did you see what happened with the US and Afghan training mission in Afghanistan. It's such a shame that in an area where we are trying to do good and improve things for the people there is being sabotaged by opposing efforts. I feel terrible for the lives lost as they gave their lives to help protect people and to be killed like that is heartbreaking. ||| Reading about the current airstrike campaign going on in Yemen terrifys me for the people that are the currently. It makes me think that maybe, even though we are doing good over there and improving things overall it isnt the right choice. Because after all there are people who are being impacted their lives are being impacted by these strikes.  ||| Have you heard about hwat is currently happening within indonesia. It is actually so saddening that a population of Orangutan an endangered species mind you, is on the brink of eradication at the hands of oil companies within the area. It does not make sense to me that when a country sees something like this occuring because of their business practices that they do not step in and stop the company from razing the forest as there are 1 to 2 thousand orangutans who call it home. ||| This is one of the saddest thing i have ever read that hits especially hard as a pet owner. I keep reading it trying to wrap my head around how he could be so afraid in that moment to think he would need to shoot the dog. Within the frame of the story it just does not make sense but i feel so bad to the owner for having to lose her friend like that. Absolutely sad. ||| You know with all of the issues recently within the country i had not even though about how bad it must been for Muslims living in america. When there is such a culture of racism and rudeness and hate being spewed left and right they are bound to be feeling it terribly. The fact that the number is rising this high is incredibly alarming and that people are only seeing race is awful. ||| Hearing the story of the girl on dr phil was the most heartbreaking thing i have read recently. People who are victims of sexual abuse i always feel terrible for. But to be okay with the abuse of your children absolutely breaks me. How can you be parents and think that abusing your child is okay because of the money you will make from it. Disgusting and they both should have gone to prison longer than 20 years.","To me the saddest thing about reading the article was i had completely forgotten about this Paris attack. ||| Incredibly sad, and such a realization of how often these tradgedies happen ||| There really has, it scares me to think that we are all becoming numb to this and just accepting this overall. ||| I saw people talking about that, I hope nothing bad happens. I remember that there was shooting at the Dark Knight a decade ago. ||| I agree, i know people are just desperate and looking to blame something but at the end of the day the blame can only fall onto the people that actually commit these crimes. ||| That is definetely one of the scarier attacks. My mother is an elementary teacher and after the attack i remember her being afraid and scared as they had to do drills at schools. These are so frequent it feels like there is just nothing that can be done but to hope the response is quick to them. ||| They really are, makes me sick to my stomach to think that there are even people capable of killing innocents like this ||| I agree, ideally i would love if these people got help and were able to fix whatever is wrong with them but do not take it out on others. It feels like there is still a mental health stigma that makes people unlikely to get help ||| Definetely but how do they go from that feeling to i am going to shoot up a crowd of innocent people. I think that is where we need to focus on the tipping point. ||| I agree, they are ingrained within society and people feel strongly about them. Alongside that at the end of the day it feels like these individuals would commit these acts with or without access to a firearm ||| Definitely, well even though to topic was sad it was nice talking to you. goodbye ||| I found it to be incredibly frustrating and sad, i think it is a shame that more is not being done to protect that forest and more importantly the Orangutan that call it home. ||| Exactly, and whats even more questionable is the lack of action from the Indonesian government. Almost like people have just decided it is okay if certain species go extinct. ||| More likely than not. Even though it shouldn't be necessary maybe if only there were tax incentives or something for these companies if they are helpful with the environment. ||| Yeah i don't think they will stop until we are actually at the brink, or stopping makes them more money of course. ||| Never had the chance myself but that is even more chilling, it is very easy to forget just how intelligent these animals really are. It doesn't make sense how people could look at the animals that are affected and not think maybe we shouldn't do this. ||| I agree, i actually don't think it is possible for it to get better before it gets worse. People need to actually see the outcome of there actions before they can change. ||| They have to be getting close, and i believe it honestly. With how much pollution that has occured for the sake of greed i pray that we are able to change before the we finish the job on the earth. ||| I agree, almost like a united nations for environmental protection. Where the largest countries come together and ensure that change begins to occur. But that wont happen with so many people currently in power denying the issue. ||| They are definetely making a ton of money on keeping quiet and ignoring the issue. My big hope is maybe all this greed and innovation leads to the renewable energies like wind and solar starting to pay off big for us and maybe we start to phase out oil. ||| I agree, but it is either accept new technology and change or watch as the world just gets worse and worse in the coming years ||| Yeah lets hope, and nice to meet you also. goodbye. ||| She is definitely partially at fault for not keeping her dog on a leash like she was supposed to but at the same time i am unsure if there is really any blame to pass around. All i know is i feel awful for her. ||| I can't blame him either, the way i see it is this is just a sad accident. ||| I think the rules are perfectly fine, they are clear about no animals of their leashes. Do you think anyone should have been charged or fined? ||| I agree he was well within his rights and he probably really felt threatened. I could not either but i definitely understand people who do. If i was the owner i don't think i would be able to get another dog after that though. ||| Definitely, i hopefully the owner is able to find peace. At the end of the article it seems like she is coming to terms with it being an accident ||| For sure, but once she comes to terms with not blaming him i hope she does not start to blame herself in anyway. ||| Yeah, hopefully the only think that comes of this is everyone moves on in their own way. ||| Yeah most likely just a playful dog. I think if they dog were going to bite it would have lead with barking or given a sign. I wonder if the man has had any bad experiences with dogs in his life that caused him to react. ||| Thats what i was thinking yeah. ||| Not anymore but i have had dogs before, never big ones like the woman. Have you? ||| Better way to go than the one in the story that poor thing. Feels like losing your best friend. ||| No i don't think so. ||| Likewise, goodbye. ||| I feel so bad for all those poor frogs, what do you think should be done to stop the spread of the disease. ||| Yeah definitely, and it is a good thing that people are more interesting in helping to preserve wildlife with these man made ponds but the side effects of it are upsetting. The scientific community definitely needs to let people know before more of the population gets infected though. ||| That would be the best way for sure, wouldn't want it to get to the point where so many of the home ponds would have to be filled. ||| Yeah it happens way too often, The problem is is that people can't really see outside of their bubble in a way. All these people think is it would be cool to have a pond and buy some frogs to bring in. We need to be better educated on the side effects. ||| I know it mentioned that the disease did not start organically or it did not start in the UK. And for sure but can like the average person really think about something like that happening, i feel like the issue is more so about people not being informed enough when they want to do something like this. ||| Yeah maybe, building a pond is a pretty big undertaking so at some point during the process somebody should be informing them or giving them the info they need into what they are doing and the harm they could be causing right. ||| I think they should definitely get some of the info themselves but i think the shops are also a big part of where they should get the info from. ||| Exactly, it feels like at some point anyone who wants to build a pond they should come into contact with someone who should be knowledgeable about the current issues and inform them. Maybe require some form of education before you can own something like this? ||| Yeah that would be for the best. That way people know the current issues and can help protect the environment. Sadly it doesn't completely solve the issue but it is a step in the right direction ||| For sure it would, i just hope that the UK amphibian population is able to build itself back up once more immune frogs start reproducing. ||| Likewise, goodbye ||| It is a bit sad to say but i had forgotten about this terrorist attack because of how often they happen now a days but reading this article is so heartbreaking. ||| It makes me upset in a way that the fact that we can even forget about something this horrific is possible. It feels like nothing is being done, or at least nothing is being accomplished. ||| I am not sure really. I want to say just stop trying to meddle in other countries business cause that is what creates resentment and these people. ||| Let the other countries solve their problems on their own and focus on the problems we have at home cause there are many of them. But then the world may look at those countries as selfish no? ||| Yeah i agree. I feel so bad for all of those families effected also. There must have been some who lost more than one person in the attack. ||| I always wonder how someone who survives something like that moves on afterwords, i feel like feeling safe after is difficult. ||| Yeah for sure, Reading the article is always harder when they include names and faces. Really reminds you that these are people instead of just the number of them hurt. ||| Yeah he was lucky, it really feels like at it is just about being lucky sometimes to live through these things ||| Definetely so many of things, just everything completely out of your control. Hopefully something like that does not happen again soon. ||| That and making sure that everyday counts, things like that really remind me of that. ||| Definetely, even though the story was heartbreaking it was nice talking to you. goodbye ||| Reading about the crisis that these villagers are in is pretty upsetting and scary, do you think other countries should step in and help? ||| It really is, over 5,000 of them hurt taken and just used as hostages it is just horrifying. I wonder just how the government and country even let it get to this point. ||| So many people, must be awful to be a family member of those taken. Just not knowing if they are safe. Just left to assume the worst. ||| Horrifying, i really wonder why we do not here more about things like this in other parts of the world. ||| Very hard to believe. You would think that massive tragedies like this shouldn't happen anymore. I wonder how much longer until Iraq is a stable country, ||| I have to believe it will be eventually. But at the same time i feel like the US has been there for the last 20 years and it is in the same spot. Maybe outside help isn't working ||| Definitely a long way to go. But other countries that have gone through terrible crises like this have recovered so maybe hoping and believing it will get better is okay. ||| Thanks, hard to be optimistic when stuff like this happens but better that than sulk. Do you think airstrikes are the right way to solve the issue, i feel like it just creates more resentment. ||| Yeah the impact it could have on the villagers is also incredibly scary. It seems like no matter what they are at risk of being harmed to get rid of the militants but as long as an effort is being made to free them. ||| Yeah maybe, hopefully they just keep the safety of the villagers as one of their biggest priorities. Don't want more people to be hurt and make the situation even worse. ||| Yeah so do i, well it was nice talking to you even if it was about something sad. goodbye ||| I felt pretty bad reading it, with all the issues going on in the country right now i had never even though of how bad things must be for Muslims living in America ||| I knew obviously that there was a big rise after 9/11 happened but that the number is reaching a high once again is alarming. Makes you wonder why it is never reported on. ||| I think the the current debate over immigration has a lot of people feeling a very us vs them mentality as of late. People are only seeing race right now and using that to decide american or not american. ||| Definitely not helping matters at all. I really hope that this is the worst things will get and over time things start to improve for all Races in the US. ||| Yeah maybe, But i feel like minorities were feeling the same way 50 or 60 years ago which makes me sort of discouraged ||| Well Yeah the crimes has only been spiking lately but the crimes are only a symptom of race relations in the country right? Or at least thats how i see it. ||| Definitely, what do you think could be done to maybe calm the racial tensions? ||| Yeah that could be really helpful, and i think start with kids maybe. Educate them on accepting others and seeing others as equal and hope that things change over time. I'm not to sure really. ||| Yeah for sure need to make sure that the bad ideals are not passed on. Also maybe the kids will end up teaching their parents something too. ||| Whatever the solution is hopefully it is found soon. ||| Yeah been a nice conversation. bye ||| Reading about that situation with the poachers was pretty upsetting. To think that the changes being made to ensure poaching ends and they are being stopped by local governments is just upsetting. ||| Yeah that could be possible, and so terrifying to just be doing your job and being attacked like that. I wonder if this is the right way to stop poaching, or if there was a better way than having people just have to grab poachers in towns like that. ||| Yeah it definetely felt like the article just wanted you to just to the conclusions on your own. I'm guessing the poachers were members of the community and that caused the mob. I wonder how the poahcer even got away from them in the first place. ||| Yeah for sure as easy as it seems there is so much ground for them to cover and animals to protect. If only they had more resources or there was a way to stop black market trade so poachers are not incentivized to hunt these animals. ||| No i don't think there was a mention of it. They only mentioned the country and the continent so the first thing my mind jumped to was to african elephants which i think are still endangered. I definitely think that there is progress being made on poaching and hope stories like this are not commen. ||| Yeah for sure, it seems like we never really hear articles that are good news or updates on constant issues. Or maybe that is that people know that those articles would not cause as much noise so there is less interest in talking about them. ||| I don't think there is any good way to deal with the villagers, if it was a mob of people that attacked them then what do you do arrest them all? I think at best the rangers just now no they must be careful with that village. ||| Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse. ||| Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching. It feels bad but maybe there should be incentives for villages if the population of poached animals gets above a certain point? ||| Definetely, and people can only really see things for their immediate self. It is hard to think of the overall elephant population when you are now going hungry because you cannot hunt them. Oh well, even though it was about a harsh topic it was nice talking to you. goodbye ||| After reading that article i think what makes me the saddest is hearing that the Doctors Without Borders facility was hit during the morter attack. Volunteers who just wanted to help people, terrible. ||| So terrible, and incredibly upsetting. I find it so hard to believe that anyone could knowingly target something like that or a hospital or something. It just seems wrong. ||| Definitely, it must be their worst nightmare come true. It makes me wonder whether or not people can still believe in their side of the conflict when they are attacking volunteer hospitals. ||| If i had to guess it is just a message to get out of the country or something like that. I could not think of anything else. ||| I would hope so, I want to believe that they did not know what the building was or it was amistake that it was hit but that may be wishful thinking. ||| Yeah they definetely wouldn't. I know that there is a good reason for the US to be there and they are trying to improve things for the citzens there. But when i read about the loss of lives like what happened with the soldiers also it makes me question our involvement. ||| Yeah it seems like while it may help people in the short term in the long term it just makes everyone resent us more. ||| Definitely, as selfish as it sounds those countries may just need to fix their problems without us cause we may just be making things worse. Or at least let organizations like Doctors Without Borders help where they can ||| I just hope that the organizations are able to protect themselves, after what happened here i could see them being unwilling to go to certain places out of fear for their safety, which makes sense. ||| Yeah either security or guarentees from leaders or governments that they will not be harmed in anyway, but even then that only goes so far ||| Yeah was nice talking to you. goodbye ||| So do you agree with the US involvement in the situation in Yemen or do you think we should let it sort itself out? ||| Yeah i'm a bit on the fence about it myself as i know that the situation in the country will be awful without us but with us there are still innocents being hurt like the taxi driver in the article. ||| I agree definetely. One thing that i have been wondering though is the location of the sites hits, hospitals etc. it seems like whenever air strikes are involved the collateral gets a bit to high and like resolution in other means should be attempted ||| Definetely, feels like the only people who know what is actually going on are the civilians and soldiers or volunteers with their boots on the ground. ||| Yeah that makes sense, maybe the fix they think is that the current advisors are making mistakes in the way they operate and are trying to narrow it down to fewer key people. Or make that information is getting muddied in translation within the coalition and they are harder to control. ||| yeah definetely, the real shame and real war crime here is that these rebel groups see the civilian populous as nothing more than a shield that they hide behind to make finding peace more difficult. And with ever strike more of the civilians will aid them and see their side of things. ||| Definetely but still they have a duty to find a resolution and end to the conflict with as little casualties as possible, it seems like often in conflicts like this people only think of the quickest way to end things and rarely the safest way to. ||| That was one of the first thing i thought of when i heard about the strike. That impacts to many pockets too not have a big response. I hope that the US advisors are able to deter any major response there because it really makes me fear for the civilians if they are not able to. ||| Yeah eight children, and they are definetely all aware of just how dangerous being in the area is as the driver joked with his family he hoped he was able to return that day. What other option do they have to stay though, leave the country and become refugees. So few countries are willing to accept them. ||| Exactly feels like it is the worst case scenario for the civilians there. Well even though the subject matter was pretty depressing it was nice talking to you. bye ||| I think it is absolutely disgusting that a pair of parents could do that to their children personally, and i think she should not forgive them or even be in contact with them for what they did. ||| That was what i was thinking too, 20 years for scaring your child forever and sexually abusing them. Do you think they have really reconciled with what they did? ||| I agree, it just goes against too many natural instincts that we as humans have. To think that they could look at their child and only see the money that they could gain from it digusts me. And honestly the fact that they even allowed the mother or father to go on the show seems very wrong to me also. ||| Definitely,  i know that their show is about making money and saying that the abuser and abusee will confront each other is good for views but i just think about how their parents are once again profiting from their childs abuse and it just makes my skin crawl. ||| I don't personally see how it could be but if it gets her any closure or helps her then i guess it is fine. ||| What makes me upset is thinking about why she would even do this in the first place. I can only imagine she needs the money from the show or something cause why face these people. ||| maybe she has just come to terms with the experience and now sees it as a paycheck that can also help her get some closure. But yeah that makes sense. I also think it is awful how the mother is claiming it was all the fathers idea and she just gave in to his idea after three months, you don't just become okay with the idea of abusing your child. ||| Exactly or report him to the police or try to get him help, but to give in? Absolutely disgusting and for her to try and just shrug it off as his idea shows she did not learn anything in prison and is still rotten to the core. ||| Exactly, it really makes me wonder why she was even released from prison if she did not improve or was not rehabilitated in any way  since she clearly doesn't show true remorse. ||| I agree there are certain people who cannot be redeemed and crimes that cannot be forgiven and this is definitely one of them. ||| 10+ 2 messages count as one turn, but yes it was nice talking to you. bye"
p029,"It sounds like these boys had a really rough life.  I do think we all have personal responsibility for our choices at the end of the day though.  Even though you might have it rough, ultimately it is up to you to decide to break the law or use drugs or not.  So they had free will too and could have exercised that.  Regardless, it is still sad that they went through a rough childhood.  Nobody should have to endure that and kids are the saddest victims. ||| This is very sad.  I can't imagine having elephants come stampede my house in the middle of the night.  What a terrible and sad situation, and these poor people can't even do anything about it.  Someone needs to stop the deforestation and stop polluting the air these people breathe, it is not right ehat they are doing and all for the sake of turning a profit.   ||| It's very tragic what happened to this woman.  It just seems like it was so avoidable.  There were so many warning signs that were ignored where people could have intervened and gotten her the help she needed.  I just think things like this happen too often where people get swept under the rug and professionals and others overlook what should really be treated as major warning signs.  I think lives could be saved if people would be a little more attentive to things like this.   ||| This was a sad situation.  It is unfair for all these people to live in such conflict and persecution fo their beliefs.  It makes me very grateful to live somewhere that I have the freedom to believe what I want.  People complain so much about America and don't realize how good we have it here.  These people are literally dying just for what they believe which is really sad.  I feel sad for the families.  ||| I find it sad that elephants are still being poached and killed just for their tusks.  Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made.  I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?  I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.   ||| It is sad to hear what is happening with the elephants.  Seems they are innocent victims here and nobody is doing much to help out.  It seems too like a problem with such a huge scope that there is not much people can do.  It is sad that they are suffering, I don't think any animals should have to suffer at the hands of humans especially just for the need to make money which is all this was avbout.  Really a tragedy. ||| It's sad that the young woman died.  I feel sad for her family and friends who have lost a loved one.  It does sound kinda like an unnecessary death but I guess she knew the risks when she decided to become a fighter pilot.  It seems like a dangerous profession and like these things could easily happen.  I guess they could easily be avoided just by avoiding this career altogether but anyway.  It is what it is.  Very sad anytime a person dies. ||| This was sad!   Being one of four fighter jet pilots who are female is a pretty big deal so she definitely accomplished a lot.  I guess the hope would be that others could learn from this tragedy.  Whether it was an issu with the jet itself or a lack of training, hopefully they can figure out what caused this tragedy so it can be prevented in the future.  I feel sad for her family and loved ones who lost a close friend.  Very sad and it sounded like she was a good person too. ||| Wow, how sad!  This is truly terrible that this happened.  What an absolutely horrible situation!  I just can't imagine the horror of the people watching as well as those involved.  It must have been a terribly scary scenario for everyone, including the people watching and especially the people involved.  The children who lived will obviously be permanently scarred and have lost their parents which is even worse.  I really found this heartbreaking.   ||| Wow, 100,000 deaths is a massive amount!  I found this very  it makes me very sad for the people involved especially the fact so many infants and children's were affected.  This just seems like something that could have been very avoidable if the right steps were taken. I mean a haze killing 100,000 people?  That's crazy! I think it's sad that it's happening in what is probably an underfunded area where the people don't really have much freedom.  Overall this is just a bad situation, it makes me very sad for the people involved. ||| I find it sad that the little baby rhino has passed away.  Surely it lived a short life and it did not deserve a day.  Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?  Anyway, this is sad news although life does go on and it is the way of the world I guess. ||| Wow, a twelve year old russian girl commited suicide because of her association with some website that promoted teens committing suicide.  It's really sad that sick people would go online and prey on little children like this.  I find it shocking and hard to believe anyone would want to do such a thing.  They really need to find a way to crack down on these people and put them away for life.  This is just ridiculous. ||| I think it's sad that so much plastic in the ocean is affecting wildlife the way it is.  It's really unfair the way we have destroyed their ecosystem with our own selfish use of plastic.  It is terrible when you see pictures of all the plastic in the ocean.  Apparently these birds are even being tricked into thinking plastic is food since it smells like food to them.  That is so unnatural and just wrong really.  and all this has happened in just a short period of time! ||| I felt like this was really sad for the people involved.  They are caught in a situation with no real solution and there is not much they can do.  I try to imagine being in their shoes and it is diffivult to fathom, but I am certain it would be very difficult and distressing.  No one should have to fear for their life on a day to day basis and it sounds like Germany is making decisions som ewhat arbitrarily or with bias.  However, on the same token it is up to Germany to decide who they want to let in, and it is generous of them to do so to start with.  So there is that. ||| I think it's sad that the golden eagles are being killed by manmade technology.  It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway. ||| In this case I totally support the actions of the man who shot the dog.  He was totally within his rights and it was highly inappropriate and inconsiderate of that woman to have an unleashed dog running int he park.  The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.  Somebody needs to do something to stop this problem. ||| After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely. ||| Ehh I never really know what to think about claims like this.  On the one hand, her roommates claim that they remember hearing her talk about it at the time.  On the other hand, why wait twenty years to bring up an incident that happened that was that disturbing?  I think some women are making allegations and accusations just to get attention or for political motivations.  Who knows why.  People do crazy things for crazy reasons.  I'm just really skeptical of a lot of these things I hear and I think the #metoo movement has gotten way out of hand.  Sorry, just my two cents.   ||| I am never sure what to think about these people.  I mean if he did actually harrass her that is bad and deserves attention.  But if she is just making up the allegations then shame on her.  I think the me too movement has gone too far with too many people making up allegations and ruining the lives of men.  However, in this case Thomas was already guilty of harrassing Anita Hill so it is probably more likely to be true.  Either way it is always hard to tell.   ||| This is a sad case of what seems like an elderly woman getting lost.  I feel sad for the family involved and the feelings they must have.  Or did they even notice she was gone?  You would think they would be out looking for her if they noticed.  Maybe it was just a lonely old woman by herself which is even more sad.  Either way, I feel like elderly people in general are often overlooked and that is unfortunate.  They should deserve the same respect that younger people do   ||| This is sad for the woman and the family!  It sounds like she had some sort of dementia and alzheimers which is really scary.  Hopefully she is okay and will be able to be reunited with her family.  It is sad when people get so old that they are deteriorating so much.  I hope my parents don't decline that much as they age but they possibly will.  My grandparents definitely.  anyway, hopefully, they can get better services to help people like this and avoid situations like the one in the article.   ||| I must say I really disagree with her politics and am not at all a fan of hers.  However, it is always sad for a person to suffer from a disease such as Parkinson's so I am sympathetic for what she must have gone through as well as for her family as well.  I'm sure it was hard on them watching her deteriorate and suffer and that is always so rough on the family.  So regardless of how I feel about her career or her actions, I have sympathy for what she went through and for her family's feelings. ||| To me this was very sad to read.  These parents lost their child and many other people lost loved ones in this senseless attack.  It just seems like it's gotten unsafe to go anywhere public these days with large crowds.  The situation is obviously out of hand in France and it is bad in the United States too.  Everywhere really.  I don't trust the terrorists or Muslims and there are many other problematic groups as well.  The problem is with humanity and it is very sad.   ||| Wow, hearing about things like this really makes me so grateful to be an American.  I'm very happy to live in this beautiful country and I wish people would stop complaining so much about everything they think is wrong here.  Just be grateful you're not being used as a human shield.  Some of the things going on over there are just atrocious, and as bad as people think it is here it doesn't even hold a candle to that.  I am saddened to hear about these families and children being harmed so maliciously. ||| I found it a little hard to relate to this situation.  It seems so far away and I can't really connect with any of the people involved.  I'm really sad for these families and their children.  It seems like they are in a difficult position without much option or anything they can do about it.  I hope they are able to find some resolution or some solution, but it doesn't seem like much is going to change there anytime soon.  I don't think this is the problem of the United States and we should remain uninvolved. ||| I'm sorry for the hate crimes happening against Muslims and others, but to blame this on Trump is absurd.  It's more of the left wing media trying to pin things on him.  There have been hate crimes going on for a long time, and even the article said they were at the same level they were in 2015 before he was even elected.  I would blame social media and the way people spread information now.  Plus a general anger that has entered society and people feel it is acceptable to take it out in violence against others.    ||| To me this is very disturbing.  55 civilians were killed?  I mean I get that they killed some bad guys too, but to me it is not worth sacrificing so many innocent lives just to kill a few bad guys.  U.S. troops were killed too.  This whole thing is just terrible and tragic in my opinion.  IT sounded like some protocol was not followed either, which makes it even worse.  I think we need to mind our own business and get out of there honestly.  We have enough issues with our own country to be over there contributing to issues in others. ||| Wow, this is very sad.  All these poor people who lost their lives because of this ongoing conflict.  I must say, this whole area just constantly seems caught up in some terrible conflict, tension, war, and violence.  I don't understand what is going on over there, but I know it is very sad to hear about innocent people being killed as a result.  I also feel sad for the U.S. Soldiers who lost their lives.  Their families must be grieving terribly.  So the whole thing is a tragedy, and it all just seems so unnecesary to me.  All this senseless killing. ||| The article did not give much information about where the refugees were from.  I had to google to learn they were mainly from Syria.  I thought this was very sad, although it is one of those problems without an easy solution.  Who is supposed to be paying for these people to be cared for?  Taxes?  Whose taxes?  I don't see a simple fix here.  It's easy to sit there and judge and say this is unfair, but also what is everyone supposed to do?  AT least they are being given asylum from the dangerous place they came from I guess.   ||| I found this to be very sad.  These people obviously don't have many options, and they are trapped in a bad situation without any food and with a lot of violence around them.  I have heard a lot about this area and the bad things going on there.  This is an ongoing situation that shows no signs of improvement, and meanwhile the people continue to suffer and die.  Young people are affected as well as women and many innocent people who have nothing to do with the terrorist groups causing all these problems. ||| Overall, this is a really sad incident.  The poor dog was just helplessly left in the car to suffer, and there's no way it could have let itself out or saved itself.  IT's really sad to me when people are this negligent about pets and other people.  Especially vulnerable populations.  Honestly I think whatever punishment she gets, such as an animal cruelty charge, is definitely deserved and she will just have to take that as it comes.  She should have been more careful with the animal, end of story.   ||| I am sad for the wolf but this didn't have me too torn up.   I imagine the sniper shot the wolf for some reason.  It's too bad the wolf traveled so far looking for a mate just to be killed, but I guess these things happen sometimes.  Perhaps the sniper should have been a little more careful.  A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason.  Wolves can be harmful creatures.   ||| I am not sure how I feel about this.  This guy is a lifelong criminal and honestly I don't think people like that deserve citizenship.  His parents messed up when he was young, yes, but he could have taken the responsibility to fix that as an adult.  He should have looked into it instead of spending so much time and energy breaking the law.  So I think he deserves what he is getting and should have been more careful.   ||| This whole situation is alarming.  It's scary that such sick individuals exist out there that will commit such horrible crimes.  It makes me feel like the world is a scary and horrible place.  I'm not really sure what else to say about it.  I hope justice works and is brought against these people.  This type of thing should never happen and I feel bad for the victims and families involved.   ||| This is pretty sad for the elephant.  It obviously has no say so in this matter and that is not okay.  Elephants are very intelligent and sensitive animals.  They shouldn't be kept in captivity in these circuses and shows I do not think.  This seems inhumane and not right.  I would feel guilty going to a circus seeing elephants parade around.  Maybe at a zoo where they could be in a natural habitat it could be okay but not in a circus where they are supposed to dance around for human entertainment, that is just pitiful and sad. ||| It's very difficult to fathom living somewhere where airstrikes can take you out at any given moment, regardless of where you are.  It really makes me grateful to live in this beautiful nation where we live, America, and to have the freedoms that we have.  In this story, the man's eight children lost their father and his wife lost her partner.  That is very tragic, and all for a bunch of senseless killing.  The US was supporting these airstrikes which is sort of sad.  I find the whole situation over there so senseless.  IT's like they are all just killing each other nonstop for no valid reason. ||| Wow, how sad.  So many people dead for no reason.  This sounds just like a terrible accident to me, I mean they think it could have been caused by lightning striking?  What are the odds?  It's so sad when things like this happen that result in such a massive loss of life.  I feel bad for all the families affected and plus of course all the victims who lost their lives due to something so unnecessary.  Sometimes things like this just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it I guess. ||| This is kinda sad, although it's good that they caught this guy before he did any further damage.  IT is sad for the women he already assaulted though.  He is clearly some sort of serial rapist and needs to be put where he cannot harm any more women because he has already harmed too many.  This type of thing is always sad because the victims can't undo the harm that's already been done to them.  Going through a length trial just brings it all back up and everybody l oses. ||| This is a horrible tragedy.  They didn't give the age of the boy, but either way it is horrific for him and the family.  Imagine the horror of being trapped in a tiny well for hours and hours until finally you die.  I imagine you would dehydrate and it would be extremely painful and scary.  It's sad that no one got to him in time.  I am also heartbroken for the family, how terrible.  I'm sure this is the kind of thing no one ever expects to happen.  Why was no one watching him? ||| This is so sad to read.  What a horrible tragedy for everyone involved - the boy himself, his parents, his family, his community.  It must have been a terrible and very scary way to die to be trapped in that well shaft for four days.  Also, the parents must have been beside themselves, I mean can you imagine?  It just sounds completely horrific and with such a terrible ending too.  It would have been much different if they had been able to rescue him but clearly that was not possible.  Overall this is a nightmare situation and one that no one should have to suffer.   ||| This is so preventable!  Why aren't people more careful with their drugs?  It's crazy to blame something like this on pharmaceutical companies or anyone other than the drug users themselves, and there is really no excuse for a baby to ever get their hands on someone's medication.  Keep it in a cabinet very high up out of reach where the baby can not get to it, no exceptions!  This is ridiculous and the majority of the time the person doesn't even need to be taking the drug in the first place.  They are just abusing it due to their own addiction or weakness.  For shame. ||| This sounds like one of those situations where not much can really be done.  It's sad for the animals who are dying and suffering and I feel bad for them.  I think this is out of anyone's control and really just an act of nature.  Sometimes thiings like this just happen and it's sad and a tragedy but no one can do anything to fix it.  The animals are the ones that suffer.  They are in essence having a drought and starving due to it which is really sad.   ||| This is clearly sad because of the innocent people involved.  IT is always a tragedy when innocent civilians are caught up in the violence and politics of a government in trouble.  This seems like the situation here, and the people are the ones who are paying the price.  It is unfortunate these groups can't see the harm they are doing and just cease all violent activities.  When are people going to learn?   ||| This is sad, I have not heard of this Indian Pakistani issue but it sounds like it is affecting a lot of people and a lot of lives.  I can't imagine living somewhere where you constantly  had to fear being bombed or shot or some catastrophe like that that caused imminent death or bodily harm.  It would just be so stressful and difficult to have to live like that.  I get worried about things like getting sick but jeez this just takes it to an all new level.  It makes me very grateful to live where I am instead of somewhere like that.   ||| This really sounded like a misunderstanding that resulted in the loss of life.  How very tragic for these three people and their families.  Perhaps better measures should be taken at this facility to be sure that they are identifying people correctly and that nothing else like this happens again.  I think a lot of military casualties are extremely sad, but it seems especially bad when it is not even in combat and just in a situation like this that should have been harmless. ||| People love to blame Trump for anything and everything that goes wrong in this country while he is in power.  The truth is that hate crimes have been ongoing for many decades, an d it has nothing to do with the man in office.  There were multiple hate crimes while Obama was in office and really every other president before him.  People, especially the media, love to scapegoat Trump.  Just like the article said, Trump has actually done a lot to try to build up the Jewish communities.  Black unemployment is at a record low.  Yet people continue to blame him.  Shaking my head. ||| Well I mainly just feel sad for the family of this guy.  I mean, it sounds like he drank himself to death.  That was clearly his own decision and his own doing, not something that he fell victim too.  I guess it is unfortunate that it happened but jeez if you are going to abuse alcohol that badly then what do you expect?  This is the type of thing htat happens when people make bad choices and unfortunately too often it is their family members who are left behind to pay the price and suffer. ||| This was alarming to read.  Not just the animals but the people too starving and suffering.  The whole situation was just unbelievable.  I'm not sure what can really be done.  Venezuela has tremendous systemic problems that I think would take a long time to fix.  In the meantime, it is terribly sad that the living creatures must continue to suffer like this.  People eating horses for Meat?  It is unbelievable and really inhumane. ||| I think all these stories about bullying as ultimately so very tragic.  It always involves young people getting harmed and taking their lives which is just heartbreaking.  Imagine how their families feel.  It is so cruel for other students to bully each other and be cruel to each other.  It is so very unnecessary and why treat people that way?  Why not do unto others as you would have the do unto you?  It seems that more and more this happens and people are not teaching their children how to treat other people. ||| I found this very sad.  I feel very sad for the mother and other family members who might be left behind.  It just sounds like such a tragedy that surely was very unexpected.  I'm sure the entire family who was remaining was left feeling shocked and totally heartbroken at a double loss.  The mother lost a husband and son and any other family members like children would have lost a brother and their dad.  The whole thing is just terrible really.   ||| So teen suicide is on the rise which I find very sad.  It seems so avoidable and people are way too young to be making decisions to end their life while they're still a child, I mean what on earth is that about?  I Think there has been a lot of things related to bullying that have contributed to this and also just a breakdown of the family in general.  Maybe kids don't feel like they have enough support system anymore.  I do not know but whatever the reason it is extremely tragic. ||| This was pretty sad.  It is easy to take for granted the fact that we have clean and safe water to drink and bathe with on a daily basis.  These people were struggling and didn't even have that noe basic thing.  I can't imagine living somewhere where I didn't feel like I had clean and safe water.  I don't drink the tap water here but I know I can buy it in a store and drink that safely.  It sounded like these people didn't even have that option and it was totally unfair to them.   ||| Hearing about the experiences of refugees is sad but something I have a hard time connecting with.  It's distressing to hear about children who are innocent victims of violence in a country or even adults, but it just seems so far away and I Feel so removed from those things and people that it's hard to relate to.  I am still sad for them that they have the experiences they have and I am grateful for my life and freedom in America. ||| I think it's good that some groups in Saudi Arabia are taking steps to give women more freedom.  It's obvious that women there are treated like second rate citizens and do not have many liberties, so anything that can be done to fix this is a positive thing I believe.  This is 2019 and there's no reason why a woman should need a male escort to do anything.  That sounds ridiculous to me as an American woman.  I feel sad for the women living in these nations.  What poor luck.   ||| This is pretty sad for the birds.  I find the amount of plastic in the ocean in general to be alarming, and it's always terrible to see it affecting wildlife.  It is vvery unfair to them really.  It would be like someone coming in and just polluting your house with their trash and there was nothing you could do about it and it started making you sickk.  I think we need to do something about the plastic issue, maybe starting by cutting down on all the plastic we use. ||| I think this is sad for the orangutangs.  It seems unfair that their environment is being destroyed.  This whole peat forest issue seems like an environmental problem.  I don't see the need to deforest anyway.  That just seems destructive to me for no reason at all.  It seems like it is best when we just leave the environment alone and stop tampering with things and intervening.  IT always seems to have harmful consequences. ||| This type of situation really makes my blood boil.  Who do these people think they are, going out in the streets and looting like a bunch of wild animals in order to protest?  The guy was shot!  He was a clear threat to the officers and had PCP in his car.  This is ridiculous.  The officer felt he had to protect himself.  What gives people the right to then go out and loot and act like a bunch of wild animals and get more people killed in response?  How on earth is that a mature response to the situation?  I'm so disgusted. ||| Well while I am sorry for the people affected by this, it is never appropriate to protest on private land, block public highways, shoot guns at police, or throw rocks.  These people do these things then act so shocked when the police react and suddenly they are the victims.  Sorry, not in my book.  If you hae an issue, you can contact politicians or go vote.  Disrupting the peace and threatening the safety of others is not an appropriate response.  it makes me mad.   ||| So I can't exactly say this article was heartbreaking to me or anything.  I did find it sad that these frogs and other wildlife are dying and possibly suffering from this disease that people are causing by being careless.  However, like they said creating the garden ponds in general is a positive thing that people shoudl do that generally supports wildlife.  So maybe if people would just be a little more careful and take the precautions they were giving then this kind of thing would not happen so much. ||| To me, this refugee crisis is a huge problem with no clear solution.  It's extremely sad that all these innocent people are dyng and I can't even imagine having to live in one of these countries and constantly have my life and my loved one's lives in danger.  It's also difficult for other nations to have to accept so many refugees into their nation but I guess it is the right thing to do.  Hopefully they can contribute to society.  It is sad that terrorists are abusing the system to try to sneak into countries. ||| Eh I don't have strong feelings about this.  I'm sorry about the passing of a person and sorry for their family's loss, but I disagreed strongly with her political positions.  So I can't say I'm especially sad or sorrowful for her.  I am sorry just in a general sense because the loss of a life is always a sad thing and I'm sad for the family members who were left behind to grieve her loss.  So those things make me feel sad and empathetic but otherwise I Feel neutral about this. ||| This is an incredibly sad story!  All these people out trying to have fun and then they lost their lives.  I imagine the fear when they were hiding, it must have been so terrible.  And the families are just as much victims as the people who lost their lives.  The whole thing is terrible, and all of this for nothing.  Terrorist attacks are the most senseless killing and loss of life.  It is really tragic to me, and these people seem to have no regard for human life or suffering.  IT's not even human. ||| What a sad situation for these children.  Such innocent victims.  No child should have to go without food, and this is really sad for all those involved.  I'm sure the parents feel terrible too for not being able to feed their children.  I know Venezuela has some huge economic crises going on, but they really need to get a grip on their situation or their people will not make it.  The country is a great example of why a dictatorship does not work.  Democracy really is best.   ||| This is a highly disturbing story.  How could this man feel the need to harm his own children?  If we wanted to take his own life, fine, but why the children?  It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story.  But either way, I find it very sad for the kids who lost their lives for no reason.  And what about the rest of the family?  Where was the mother in this story?  How grieved she must be.  The whole thing was very very sad. ||| I found this story quite distressing.  It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers.  But I guess they support poaching in that area?  Perhaps it is important to their economy?  Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.  Really, what is wrong with people? ||| This was sad, although I Feel like we are only getting part of the story.  I googled about this camp and there were apparently a lot of refugees there causing problems.  Also, you have to think their situation at the camp is probably better than it was where they came from.  I think the camp got overwhelmed and there wren't enough resources to help these people.  Definitely sad for children, though.  I hate to think they were suffering.  I feel like we need more information to adequately evaluate this situation. ||| The politics behind this whole situation were a bit confusing to me, but it was clear that overall it is a really bad situation over there.  It mentioned several times that multiple people were brutally raped and even murdered, sometimes by government officials, and this is really distressing and sad.  That is obviously something that should never happen to anyone, so it makes me sad to hear that these people suffered like that.  I think clearly something needs to be done over there but I'm not sure what. ||| I can really get behind this ban.  It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong. ||| This seems like a horrible situation with no real solution.  It is crazy that cholera is still an issue in 2019 but apparently it is going strong in some places.  I'm not sure that there is an obvious solution except maybe better sanitation for some of these people.  But I guess some of that is cultural and not much can be done to fix it.  Educating the people about it does not seem to have helped much, nor does vaccinating them.  So what do you do, really? ||| All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves. ||| This really sounds like it could have been so much worse.  Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.  I would say these people are lucky. ||| This is kinda sad because it is just a mass tragedy.  So many lives lost, and it seems like it could have been so avoidable.  It seems like mining is such a dangerous activity in general and a very dangerous job for those involved.  It's sad for the families of these people that lost their lives, I feel bad for them.  I wish that someone could have done more to save them before it was too late. ||| This is highly alarming and so unacceptable.  Not only is it terrible that adults are using these ridiculous medications, but now they are allowing their babies to get into them and harm themselves.  It's just outrageous, and they need to have stronger penalties for these people who are letting this happen.  There is simply no excuse.  Your drugs should be up in a cabinet locked far away from your children IF you choose to have drugs like that, which you really shouldn't be taking around a child anyway.  Shame on these people. ||| Wow this is unbelievable, who on earth would do something like this to a harmless flamingo for no reason?  This guy is obviously depraved and has serious issues.  They need to punish him to the full extent of the law so he does not harm other animals or people.  I can't believe someone would do this to a living creature without provocation and just for the sick thrill of it apparently.  How very tragic and sad this is. ||| This was sad and I hope they can do something about it.  I hate that the wildlife is suffering since it is so innocent.  Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation. ||| This  is terribly disturbing.  It is horribly clear that the military actions in this area are directly affecting families and children which is just horrifying.  These are innocent victims who have nothing to do with this whole conflict and it is totally unfair that they should have to suffer as a result.  I think that something desperately needs to be done here, but what to do is the big question.  This area is always full of conflict thanks to terrorist forces and groups.  We have been there trying to help for so many years and it seems like nothing ever gets any better. ||| Wow, this is unbelievable!!!  Who would do something like this to a tiny harmless kitten?  I'm shocked and thoroughly disgusted that someone would even be able to go through the actions to harm a kitten like this.  It is just sickening and hopefully they can find this person and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law, this is just outrageous and ridiculous.  It sounds like a precursor to serial killer behavior, honestly, because who does something like that except an extremely depraved person? ||| I feel like there is more to this story.  Apparently the officer was trying to protect himself because she was punching and kicking him to try to resist arrest.  That doesn't make it okay for him to punch her in the face, though, he should have been more professional.  But he is human and it might have been his first instinct, who knows.  I saw that she is suing the city for a million dollars, I bet she is trying to bank on this whole incident.  I don't know how I feel about this really.  I don't feel much sympathy for the woman.","What did you think of this? ||| It is sad for them, no child should have to endure all that ||| well, yes and no.  we all have personal responsibility for our choices in my opinion.  regardless of circumstance ||| yes they definitely did, it failed them ||| yes that was the best part of the article ||| yeah, to turn something good from something bad and now hes helping others ||| yes it needs help, but i think there is a lack of good foster parents ||| yeah exactly!!!  And then the kids are mistreated, so saf ||| Yeah the human soul has remarkable resilience ||| Yes, and this was a pretty amazing, sad story with a good ending.  well I must go, have a good day.  goodbye ||| I thought this was a very sad situation, what did you think? ||| I was thinking poor people, but yes sad for them too ||| yeah the government should do something, it is ridiculous ||| Yes, at least to make harsher penalties and laws about this ||| yes all this just to turn a profit, with no regard for lives ||| no, I could not, can yuo? ||| same here, I could not function ||| yes or totally depraved ||| karma will catch up to them I think ||| I hope so too.  This has been a good talk goodbye ||| So I thought this was a really tragic and avoidable incident, what did you think ||| common?  I guess.  I don't really see it as an everyday occurence but anyhow ||| Yep, it is definitely their choice.  I still find it sad and very avoidable.  How sad for all their remaining family members. ||| Of course being sad is a waste of time, but it is still appropriate to feel sadness when you hear of a tragedy.  It's not like I'm dressed in black lighting candles and mourning, Jesus Christ. ||| Well then be neutral towards it or happy, that's your right.  I find it sad anytime I hear about a tragedy that happens to others.  I am sad for their family who lost a beloved family member. ||| Sure they could have, but surely there was at least one person who appreciated this woman.  The article stated as much. ||| I agree suicide is extremely cowardly and suicide angers me.  It is a terrible choice for people to make and very selfish bc they are not considering how their actions affect others who are left behind. ||| Yes, and dealing with the fallout from it and the years and years of aftermath from that person's loved ones was terrible and very straining on everyone around.  The loved ones are STILL not healed and it has been 13 years ||| Can you clarify your question?  I am not sure I fully understand.  Do you mean grief counseling, or what preventative measures are you referring to?  Like should more have been done to try to help the person to start with? ||| I think those are reasonable steps to take in some cases but in others it might just make things worse.  I really don't know the answer to that.  If someone is that determined to take their own life it seems they will do it no matter what.  What do you think?  I don't think any of that stuff would have helped int he situation I'm referring to.  But who knows. ||| That's an interesting point about animals.  We don't see them giving up and killing themselves.  Fascinating question, I have no idea what it is about humans.  Maybe it has just become a part of our culture?  Like if the first animal did it then others would follow?  No clues.  What do you think ||| Yes I wonder if it has ever been formally studied ||| OH yeah, really good point.  That would be very interesting to find out.  I guess it would be possible that they could because they do a lot of things that we do. ||| yeah exactly.  It is probably in the don't category.  I guess I could see them like refusing to eat or drink more than bringing a knife to their wrist. ||| I would think it would be passive, such as just refusing food and drink until they can't survive.  But maybe the urge to survive would override their depression?  Hard to say.  This has been an interesting conversation and I think we are at 15 messages so I will say goodbye for now and hope you have a great day ||| goodbye ||| I felt sad for these people being persecuted for their beliefs. ||| yeah seriously.  It made me very grateful to be an American. ||| yes no doubt, and to be free to believe what we want to believe ||| yeah seriously.  They seem to bring conflict wherever they go ||| yes it almost seems delusional ||| yeah seriously, barbaric almost or just archaic. ||| that's absolutely despicable.  what do you think ||| it is highly unethical, I can't think of a situation where that would ever be ok ||| Yeah, like what would possess someone to even do that? ||| yes, and pure evil ||| bye! ||| I thought it was terrible!!  What did you think? ||| Yes really!!!  I mean, slaughtering horses to feed people and animals?  That is a tragedy!!!! ||| Yeah really!  That was crazy.  I really do not know.  Venezuela has deep, deep issues.  Not easy to fix.  Whaty do you think? ||| Yeah I had the exact same thought.  Although what to do with all the animals?  If they just released them suely they would die or be slaughtered ||| Yes I thought that too, but who would pay for the move, and who would coordinate it all? ||| yeah exactly.  That would be ideal though if an organization would sponsor that ||| yeah it really is very, very sad ||| yes!  all living creatures with feelings. ||| yeah and so much waste here in the USA ||| no, sorry, do you? ||| bye! ||| Hi there, so what did you think about the article? ||| Yeah no doubt.  The only part I was surprised by (but I know practically nothing on this subject) was that elephant populations had increased in some areas and were a nuisance to the locals ||| yeah that does not make sense to me.  why on earth ||| you clearly know more about this than me, but yeah I guess that would make sense. ||| I don't know enough about it to say.  Elephants from certain countries were appendix 1 and others were appendix 2, correct?  what do you think? ||| Yeah I agree.  All they have to do is walk across an imaginary line and they suddenly have a different level of protection.  That does not make logical sense. ||| I would like to think that too, but I would imagine there is a very long way to go before there is a big difference ||| I don't see poaching decreasing or disappearing dramatically overnight.  I think it would take a long period of time and be a gradual change ||| That sounds sufficient.  Like I said, I know nothing about this topic so it is great that you are educating me. ||| I guess you would have to see if the amount of poaching actually decreases in response to the death penalty.  It would depend on how it were enforced. ||| Exactly, and then there is corruption in the government as well so that would be an issue. ||| No, but I disagree with the international community getting involved in each other's affairs in general.  This is an African issue that should be solved by the parties there in my opinion.  What do you think ||| Well that's certainly one way to look at it.  Regardless,  I hope they are able to work something out that is satisfactory to all the nations involved ||| Well that is sad.  There are species going extinct all the time. ||| And also due to natural changes in the environment which are outside of our control.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye ||| What did you think of this? ||| Yes, I thought it was a tragedy.  And for what??  greed ||| Yeah no doubt.  Then it would be oh poor me, woe is me.  I'm the victim. ||| yeah that is unfair to the animal.  people should educate themselves first ||| it just seemed there was no good solution to this ||| same here!  It is frustrating to have such a big problem with no solutioon ||| yeah for sure they are.  maybe harsher penalties?? ||| maybe so, I wonder if they have tried that yet? ||| yeah I didn't see anything about it either ||| YES, eliminate the market.  I must go, take care!  bye ||| Hi, what did you think of this? ||| Yes I agree, ,my heart went out to the family, so sad ||| yeah no doubt, I hope they can figure out what went wrong.  was it the jets or lack of training? ||| Yes for sure, and I gathered she was very young too? ||| Yeah I will not do it at all, terrifying.  So she was very brave. ||| Yeah I can't do it anymore, I find it to be a nightmare. ||| omg.  yeah, no, I refuse.  I used to fly when I Was younger but now I will drive or not go. ||| Yeah I can't imagine.  I would think they have adjusted but are not fine.  very tragic ||| yeah and she didn't even know I guess ||| Yeah seriously!  I try to avoid dangerous situations but you still never know.  being in a car is dangerous. ||| so true!  bye! ||| Wow, what did you think of this?! ||| YEs!  So heartbreaking and how traumatizing for everynoe involved ||| Yes, seriously.  Gosh and how painful for the adults who suffered, and omg the kids.  Even for the witnesses it would have been terrifying. ||| I do not go to places like that bc I am a paranoid person and this is exactly what I fear.  Just this week a roller coaster plunged off the track and two people died ||| it's just not worth it to me.  but regardless, it should be safe for these people who do choose to do it ||| no, i do not either, definitely not. ||| yeah seriously, I mean my philosophy is if it can be prevented I'd like to take those measures.  I know some people have a different approach and that is fine but this is how I choose to live my life. ||| yep, exactly.  maybe they should have better regulation of these theme park rides or somethiing, I don't know. ||| Like some sort of weekly checks.  It should not be a deadly situation. ||| You are probably right, I know nothing about it.  but yeah, that's a good point.  huge fines.  I must be going, it was nice talking to you.  bye ||| Worrisome how so?  I found it to be very tragic.  I keep thinking about the remaining family members like what if there was a wife/mother and possible siblings who lost a brother and a dad? ||| Yes exactly, same here.  It's seriously terrible.  And was certainly so unexpected too ||| Yes that's certainly something you could never come back from.  My cousin lost her husband to a kayaking accident last year.  Just to lose two family members at once is just extra terrible. ||| Yeah seriously.  I don't even like talking about it. ||| Yes good question.  I guess that would vary per person.  Some people may never recover, you know?  Certainly it would take at least six months or a year to begin to feel like you could function each day again.  I really don't know what do you think? ||| Yeah definitely it would be life altering/life ruining possibly to have something like that happen ||| Yes that is a good thing to live by every day because you just never know.  I also prefer to avoid risky activities but that's just me. ||| Yes I don't do those things either.  To me it's just not worth the possible risk and I'd rather my family members not do those things either.  Right now I can prevent my kids from doing dangerous things but I guess when they're older it will be out of my control. ||| ME too!  I put mine through torture for sure.  Ugh. ||| You too, and I hope the same.  Have a great day ||| bye ||| I find that very depressing and sad too.  What do you attribute it to?  The article didn't touch much on the causes. ||| Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking too.  I read a lot in the news about children who have committed suicide as a result of bullying, it's really heartbreaking.  IT seems so frequent. ||| yes social media is the major fuel to that fire in my opinion ||| yes and it follows them home, they can't escape it.  It's really sad.  We don't allow social media in our house, not for anyone.  It's not safe in my opinion. ||| yes that's true, my kids don't try to sneak and use it so that's not an issue at this point but it's good that's an option. ||| yes mine will not, they think they are evil, but yes being safe rather than sorry is always a good thing ||| that's kinda hard to say.  I mean, I guess one could argue that the parents could have failed to do things to protect their children in some cases.  I can't imagine if my child were being bullied and just failing to act.  And parents that allow their children to be exposed to things they shouldn't be.  I really don't know, though.  You'd have to judge that on a case by case basis I think.  What do you think? ||| yes I mean you couldn't just say that as a blanket statement.  But if a parent disregarded signs of distress then they would seem partially responsible. ||| yeah that's terrible and seems like neglect ||| yes, maybe eventually the legal system will see it that way too ||| Yes I agree it makes sense and a parent has a duty to protect.  Well I must unfortunately go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you have a nice day.  goodbye ||| hey I thought this was sad!  Having safe water is kinda an assumption here, it's hard to imagin how they feel.  What did you think? ||| yeah and they are totally helpless ||| yeah seriously to try to get these people the help they need.  something needs to be done ||| yes, I agree.  families and children.  I can't imagine not having such basic needs. ||| yeah it really is sad.  i guess that is the life they know ||| yes meanwhile the people suffer ||| no i doubt they will do anything ||| no I doubt it, so the whole thing is just a tragedy ||| I do not know, I guess wait on aid and deal with what they have? ||| yeah seriously!  not just people.  well I gotta go, nice talking to you!  bye ||| Yeah it was pretty sad I thought ||| It especially made me sad to hear about the children who were affected but the people who were adults too.  It is kinda hard to relate to but I hate that anyone has to go through that and it makes me very grateful to be an American.  How about you? ||| yes for sure.  I can't imagine having to flee my country ||| I guess it would just depend on the situation.  If I thought my childrens' lives were in danger I would do whatever I had to to protect them.  What about you ||| yes I could never do that and wouldnt expect others to ||| Not to sound pessimistic but I'm not sure these is much that can be done.  IT seems certain areas/countries have had ongoing conflict for hundreds of years and resolving that is a tremendous undertaking.  What do you think can be done? ||| yes I don't either.  It's just sad for the innocents who fall victim to it. ||| Yes extremely lucky, I feel grateful every day for being here and sometimes think about how different things could be in a bad way if I had been born somewhere else.  It's easy to take it for granted so reading things like that is a good reminder. ||| Yes you are right!!  Those things are so easy to take for granted.  And not having to fear for our safety or our family's safety every day ||| yeah I guess we can take the opportunity to feel grateful for the little things today. ||| Yeah me too.  It seems like it's just ongoing in some places like continuously no matter what.  It is sad. ||| You too, hope you have a great day.  goodbye ||| So I thought that was pretty tragic.  100,000 people is a huge number to be affected, killed even.  What do you think? ||| Yeah, what the heck?? And infants are most vulnerable which is also truly terrible. ||| I think it was from what was burning but I'm not entirely clear.  Either way, it seemed like the people couldn't avoid it bc it was in the air so they were basially helpless ||| yeah exactly, like there was nothing they could do.  And yeah that is a tremendous amount, like that could wipe out an entire city.  what on earth ||| Yeah that's what I was thinking.  The article didn't touch much on specific actions that could be taken, more just generalizations.  Is anyone even doing anything to prevent this? ||| Yeah, I got the feeling this was an ongoing thing that kept happening each year, maybe not on such a large scale but still happening ||| Yeah you would think so.  I feel quite certain something like that that was killing 100,000 people at a time would not fly in the United States. ||| Yeah definitely, I think we are pouring a lot of resources into preventing them.  Plus did they cause that many people to die?  I know there were some deaths but I didn't think it was on quite as grand of a scale. ||| Yeah that is still a lot of lives to lose though.  I guess we are pouring resources into fighting them like you said but I'm not sure about prevention or if anything could be done to prevent those.  I thought they were somewhat of a natural occurrence. ||| Yeah you are right my friend!  Careless mistakes like that can be highly costly even to the extent of people's lives.  Well it has been a pleasure discussing this with you, I hope you have an enjoyable afternoon.  goodbye ||| I thought this was rather sad just because it was the loss of an innocent life and a baby at that.  I don't know much about rhinos really. ||| Yeah I kinda assumed the same which adds an extra level of sadness to it ||| Yeah I totally agree.  I also don't know much about it but it does seem brutal and unnecessary to me.  I am not sure that they even use all the parts of the animals they kill.  I think not. ||| Yeah I am sure they form an attachment to the little animals and it is very sad to lose one.  I mean they have named them and everything. ||| Yeah exactly almost like a pet or something.  They didn't give much detail in the article so a little more information would have helped, like some background info maybe. ||| Yeah, like why did it not survive?  They really didn't touch on any of that.  What is the overall survival rate for these orphaned rhinos?  It mentioned it was a special orphanage just for them, right? ||| I remember seeing one at the zoo when I was a child.  I don't think I have since then.  That's a neat comparison as far as dinosaurs, I could see that resemblance.  Makes me want to go to a zoo! ||| Yeah you are right!  Like the horns.  It truly is a waste. ||| Yeah that's a good point, too.  It must be some pretty dedicated and caring people who do this.  I wonder who funds the whole orphanage operation. ||| Yeah, certainly there must be politics involved.  The whole scene seems very sad.  I am glad some individuals and groups are trying to do something about it, though.  It has been nice discussing this with you, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Have a great afternoon.  goodbye! ||| Me too!  As an American woman, I just find that mind-blowing and somewhat ridiculous.  I realize that their culture is very different from ours, though.  But sheesh. ||| Yeah it seems absurd.  I'm glad they are taking some steps to at least give females there some more privileges to do some reasonable things without a male escort. ||| Yeah I know right?  Like what CAN they do?  Is Saudi Arabia where they have to hide their faces or is that somewhere else?  I'm just grateful I live in the USA. ||| yeah no doubt.  I mean I honestly support traditional gender roles and all that, but they seem to take it to a major extreme there.  I think they need to loosen up the reins a little bit. ||| What do you think would work, economic sanctions?  Military power?  I am thinking that is where they see woman as objects and property, correct? ||| They seem to have been effective in other areas.  I would think that we do a lot of economic trading with Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, who knows, there could be some dangerous ramifications for us for challenging their deeply held cultural beliefs. ||| Yes and a long held tradition.  I'm sure this has been debated and discussed at length among groups such as the UN, etc.  I would think anyhow. ||| Yeah it is.  It was also interesting in the article that some women were opposing the changes.  I guess that just goes to show it is such a part of their culture they see it as normal and do not want it to change.  SEems weird to me but to each their own. ||| Yeah that is true.  You never really know with that country.  They might just be saying what they think they are supposed to say to avoid negative repercussions. ||| Right? lol.  I'm sure they have learned to say and do what will keep them out of trouble. ||| I have not heard about that but I am sure you are probably right.  It seems like senseless violence is just a part of the culture there.  Not that it isn't here either, but it seems more out of hand there.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you about this.  I hope you have a nice afternoon.  Goodbye ||| So I found this to be very tragic.  What kind of sick person creates a suicide website to attract little children? ||| Yeah me too, like they are already at a disadvantage with families where they lack support and have rampant alcoholism and abuse.  They don't need predators preying on them like this. ||| It really is!  I have heard of some of these suicide sites before and I find it appalling and sickening.  People should be trying to help the situation not fuelling the fire.  What on earth. ||| It really is unreal.  And it said that some of the owners of the sites they had found were not much older than the children they were targeting.  What would even compel someone to do something like this? ||| Yeah what on earth?  Like it makes them feel powerful or something?  I have no idea but it sounds like the mindset of a serial killer to me.  Which in a way, those people kinda are serial killers. ||| Yeah I have no idea, I am as mindblown as you are.  They should really have a special punishment for people like that who prey on these types of young victims.  I guess with every site you shut down another new one can just pop right back up.  That's the scary thing about the internet. ||| Yes, ultimately it should be the parents who are censoring and policing things like that at home but obviously in these cases the parents are failing to do that job.  So who can step in to help? ||| Yeah, like if they got things like this more out in the open. ||| Yes and maybe have very harsh punishments for the offenders they catch. ||| Yes! Like charge them with homicide.  It has been nice discussing this tragic topic with you.  goodbye ||| Hi there, so I found this to be sad.  It's always so tragic reading about plastic in the ocean and how it's harming wildlife there.  What did you think? ||| Yes but I don't think that's realistically going to happen.  It's like a problem with no solution. ||| sometimes recycling is very difficult for people.  it's not always as easy as it sounds ||| I live in a very rural area where you have to drive your own garbage to a landfill that is ten minutes or more away and is only open a few hours several days a week ||| yeah I thought about doing that too.  Part of the problem is our house is already unbelievably cramped and there is literally nowhere to store extra garbage.  we already can barely fit the one garbage can we have.  I have four kids. anyway, not trying to make excuses just saying some cities definitely make it easier ||| yeah when I lived in a city there was no excuse not to recycle unless you were just lazy.  you just set the container out on the curb.  it's very different here. ||| the recycling center IS the landfill, same place you take your trash to ||| yeah and since it's only open a few days we already have several bags stacked up waiting to go on those days.  we bought cans to put them in outside but you can't have but so much garbage just sitting around outside your house or it starts to attract wildlife.  anyway.  just a difficult situation as far as recycling. ||| yeah I wish they made it easier.  The trash situation in general out here sucks.  some people pay a service to come pick up their trash but we can't afford that.  so there ya go.  but it is sad about those birds in the ocean.  I bought re-usable water bottles for us so we try to minimize our trash ||| hydroflask?  I will check that one out.  Well it has been good talking to you about this issue.  I hope you have a great rest of your afternoon.  goodbyes ||| t ||| so did I, am I sorry, I accidentally hit enter and it sent before I could type.  I was going to say that was very sad, what did you think?  I think the amount of plastic in our ocean is ridiculous ||| seriously it would be like someone coming and just dumping trash in our houses ||| me too, i use so many plastic water bottles ||| I think they will.  they make a big deal of it at my kids' school ||| no me either.  I personally think climate change is just a natural occurrence and data shows it actually has benefits for our planet, but the trash problem is a separate issue. ||| yeah seriously, and convenience is a huge factor.  not to mention it would take such a major overhaul to eliminate all the plastic.  it's in practically everything ||| yeah their trash problem is insane though, have you ever looked at pics?  it's disgusting ||| lol no doubt, it's like filling the streets ||| I hope so too!  bye ||| hello, what did you think of this? ||| Yeah me neither, you're right.  I felt really bad for the men it described, I mean how scary, but on the same token Germany has a right to turn away whomever they want ||| yeah for sure, I do too.  Like a nation refugees could go to that was made just for them. ||| yes,that considered each individual sitution.  I can't imagine how many applications they have to process, though, and someone has to pay for all this ||| yeah no doubt.  It ||| sorry, I hit enter too soon.  yes, so true!!  it just seems like such a sad situation without any real practical solution ||| yeah it's definitely a situation where the bad actions of some ruin it for many ||| sometimes walls are necessary, as there are many who want to come in and not be productive members of society.  again, the bad who ruin it for the good ||| like what? ||| yes, but the wall isn't made for people already living here.  anyway, I hear you and you seem to have a good heart.  I must go, have a good day! bye! ||| Hey there.  I find it distressing anytime human technology is leading to the death of animals.  It seems so very frequent and common.  What did you think? ||| Yes indeed we do.  It's really unfair to them but it's like an inevitable thing as society continues to grow. ||| Yes I agree.  It seems particularly sad when it is an endangered species that is being compromised.  I did not see anything in the article about what they planned to do to fix the situation, did you? ||| Yeah I agree with what you are saying completely.  It seems like in trying to fix things, there are often unintended consequences that further harm other things. ||| Yeah totally!  And so many other things.  You would think we would have learned our lesson by now but nope. ||| Yeah that is a really good point.  You would think there would be something.  Surely scientists have vetted this out? ||| Yeah I don't hear much about it either.  I don't really seek out that info though but I do read the news every day and I never see anything about it.  I have heard about the bird issue just over the years in different settings.  It seems to be an ongoing issue for sure. ||| Yeah totally.  It's easy for people to sit there and throw out idealistic notions but when it really came down to the practicality of it all and the pros and cons were laid out including cost, what would people choose ||| That is a good point as far as not getting any input.  Our costs have gone up too and we only have one company to choose from. ||| Oh yes true, ike the other populations will get out of control.  It could set the entire ecosystem out of balance.  Such is the danger when we tamper with nature.  Well I have enjoyed hearing your insights and hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye ||| Yeah I feel bad for them too.  I don't know much about the whole palm oil issue, I found it a little confusing. ||| The whole deforestation thing sounds damaging to me in and of itself.  It seems we should b e protecting forests, not destroying them. ||| Yes, that too.  It seems so damaging on many levels.  I guess their country is pretty impoverished though and this is one of their main economic resources? ||| Yeah totally.  I mean I try to put myself in the shoes of people that live there and perhaps that is their only means.  I really don't know enough about Indonesia to say. ||| Yeah exactly.  I'd like to think they are doing the best they can and trying to ensure their people survive.  I don't know. ||| Yeah I agree.  It's like we are on different pages.  So we need to be able to take their perspective before we judge I Guess. ||| Yeah I really know practically nothing about them.  The estimate of how many were dying was really vague, like a very wide range.  I reckon it is hard for them to even know exactly the impact they are having. ||| Yeah totally, that is so very true.  And everyone has a bias or a political agenda they are trying to promote, and you can distort facts to sway things a certain way with almost anything. ||| Yeah exactly!  And we all have our biases and seek out information that confirms the things we believe and ignore other info. ||| Yeah I totally do too.  And go to my favorite news sources which are biased towards my beliefs.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you enjoy your day.  bye ||| I was so disgusted.  Sorry if you disagree.  I just think going out and looting and acting uncivilized in response to something you disagree with is such a horrible way to respond.  There are many other more mature ways to react.  And as a result, another man is dead.  What did you think? ||| Yes very much so.  But at the end of the day, the officer reacted in an effort to protect himself and the lives of other officers.  They have a very difficult job and are threatened constantly and have to make snap decisions sometimes.  This was not a racial thing.  The officer himself was African American.  So the reaction of the community was entirely inappropriate to me.  They LOOTED a Hornets store!!!  What on earth. ||| Yes, totally innocent people who had nothing to do with this.  Now their store is destroyed.  How on earth is this an appropriate response to being upset about a shooting ||| No, it's totally illogical. ||| Yes, very sad and unfortunate.  If you disagree with things that happen int he community you should write your representatives or political leaders and express your feelings ||| I think protesting in general is absurd but it is people's first amendment right. ||| yeah it just seems like it usually turns into that.  But a peaceful protest is people's right, I have no problem with that.  I just personally would never waste my time doing something like that.  That's just me.  I don't care if others do. ||| Anyhow, I'm not really sure that there is a solution to these violent protests.  It seems like it's a fairly common occurrence and it's a huge threat to the communities involved.  When will it end ||| Yes so do I.  It seems like harsher punishments would be good but it's hard to arrest and control a humongous rioting crowd. ||| yes exactly, and make things worse ||| goodbye ||| I feel sorry for the people, but I don't think these protests are appropriate at all.  They were trespassing on private land and blocking public roads, throwing rocks at officers and shooting a gun at them.  That is totally unacceptable.  There are other ways to express yourself if you disagree with something.  What did you think? ||| I really hate them too.  We can do fast, no worries! ||| yeah no doubt.  contact your congressman or something ||| yes!!!  who has time to be out doing all this mess?  it blows my mind ||| I do too, and people have a victimhood mentality.  they provoke things they cry victim ||| yes they are.  entitled and it is irritating. ||| yes, all these protestors.  they grate my nerves so much and cause way more harm than whatever it is they are protesting ||| right!  or people can't get to work or to pick up their kids or whatever.  so selfish ||| yes, and things that matter to them, too. ||| you too!  bye ||| In my opinion, the man was totally within his rights.  That dog should have been on a leash plus the owner failed to restrain it when it attacked him.  I'm fed up with people being inconsiderate of others and having unleashed dogs in public places that endanger the safety of others.  What if it had been a child? ||| Same here.  I have three small children and a teen and I don't want aggressive unleashed dogs around any of them.  Not to mention, and this is less serious, but we had to leave a park just recently bc someone's dog was pooping everywhere and they were just leaving it.  My toddlers could crawl into that and get it on their hands.  Disgusting.  So inconsiderate. ||| Oh yeah, that's totally unacceptable.  I just feel like people should be more considerate about their pets and other people.  Just have them on a leash and clean up their waste, plus take them into non-trafficked areas when they need to go.  The article also doesn't even mention the breed of the dog, I don't think, not that it really matters.  It was uncool regardless. ||| Yeah, I would have been scared myself.  You just never know with a dog.  I read things in the paper all the time about attacks.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we don't even go to their house anymore because of it. ||| Theirs is a specially trained attack Czech german shepherd.  It aggressively barks at anyone who approaches it (that is not them) and has issues.  It recently chewed up the wiring on its crate so badly that its teeth were broken. ||| Yeah exactly, and that's exactly what this dog is.  It has really damaged our relationship because we can't bring our kids around them anymore.  My sister doesn't even have kids and she doesn't feel comfortable going over there either.  Crazy.  Picking a dog over family. ||| yeah exactly!  it's insulting.  But anyway, it is what it is. ||| Oh I bet they are outraged!!  I was totally expecting to get a dog person defending the man with this HIT and dreading the ensuing conversation.  I would want to see my grandchildren and would easily re-home any pet that was standing in the way of that. ||| that was a good idea.  I guess I am already slightly biased against dogs bc of the issue with my parents, plus I am always reading about dogs that killed some innocent child or baby.  It breaks my heart.  I know dogs make great pets for some people and I support that but just be responsible and considierate. ||| I agree with you that if it is for no reason that is unacceptable.  It is also tragic to read about inncoent dogs being abused or hurt by cruel sick people.  Well thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, I have enjoyed our conversation.  Have a great day.  goodbye ||| thank you!  I think you have to type in goodbye ||| I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  For starters, the dog owner should have had her dog on a leash.  She then failed to respond and react when the man repeatedly asked her to restrain her dog.  So he acted to try to defend himself and this is the result.  I find dogs to be highly threatening and can totally understand his actions in this case.  How did you feel about it? ||| What do you mean, like euthanize dangerous dogs? ||| OMG thank you, I so strongly agree.  Literally about every week I see a case in the paper where an innocent child or baby or even adults is attacked and killed by some pit bull.  I don't understand how these things are not illegal.  And why do people want them?  IT's a safety hazard and unfair to other people.  It scares me that pit bull owners could move in next door and totally threaten my children's lives and mine. ||| it's totally unacceptable.  If you want a dog, fine, but get a calm family dog that is appropriate and not aggressive or violent.  And keep it on a leash. ||| yeah that should be a legal requirement if you're going to have a dog ||| yeah that's kinda gross.  But I guess a cultural thing.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we dont' even go over to their house because of that stupid dog ||| I really don't know.  I guess if I were going to die otherwise I would.  Would you?  I'm kinda picky about meat so this is disgusting to think about. ||| well yes certainly.  Hopefully it never comes to that.  I do find it a bit alarming that people in countries like Korea or wherever are like breeding dogs just to eat them.  That is foul.  Anyway, ||| Yes it is totally not okay.  Anyway, maybe there should be some restrictions on dogs people are allowed to own.  I would get behind that. ||| I don't really like dogs so I could get behind banning dogs altogether, too.  I doubt that will happen though.  Well it has been great discussing this with you but I must go.  Have a great rest of your day, goodbye ||| I think people should just follow some of the guildelines they were giving in the article.  Maybe they should make more of an effort to spread that information.  I felt sad for the frogs but honestly I didn't feel an overwhelming heartbreak or anything.  In general, the ponds seem to be a positive thing for wildlife. ||| Yes I totally agree with you.  LIke they need to put this info out there at shops that carry the items to stock these ponds and in other sources where people can easily find them.  To protect the frogs and the spread of these diseases ||| yeah no doubt, that would not be good.  I guess it's just an example of people being careless about things and wildlife suffering as a consequence.  Happens so frequently it's ridiculous ||| yeah exactly!  and I think they mentioned the ornamental fish too.  Did it say it was spreading to them?  Either way, people obviously aren't thinking this stuff through as well as they should. ||| yeah, so the key would be more education?  getting people, consumers especially, the information they need to make appropriate choices and protect the species ||| Yeah I totally agree.  Whose responsibility do you think it should be to inform people, or do you think the people themselves should be responsible for looking up the information? ||| Yes I agree the shops should be a main source.  They're the ones profiting from this whole thing too ||| Yeah like a contiuing ed class, it could be offered online ||| Yes I'd like to think it would at least help a little and make a difference ||| You make a good point about how dire these things can wind up being.  It has been good talking to you.  goodbye ||| Well I probably have an unpopular opinion about this but it's how I feel.  I think the #metoo movement has gone too far honestly.  I find a lot of these allegations highly questionable and I'm skeptical.  In this case, her roommates from the time period do recall her mentioning it supposedly so there seems to be some validity there.  But you just never really k now with these things, especially when it's brought up twenty years later.  Seems like a lot of women just do this for attention or whatever weird reasons they might have. ||| I would guess a little bit of both, but it could also be that more women are wanting to fabricate things and get int he spotlight bc they see it happening with other women ||| I find it very easy to believe someone would want to be recognized for that.  People will do anything for attention.  Look at reality TV and social media.  I think people should report things when they happen, not 20 years later. ||| Yep I agree, but the ones who are fabricating it and doing it for attention are ruining it for the genuine victims ||| No, you can't punish them, but honestly in my opinion you can't treat a man as though he's guilty unless there is proof.  But unfortunately, once these people make their allegations the public basically treats the person as though they are guilty and their life is destroyed, and often their career and the lives of their family members.  So to me it is just very sad.  And it scares me for my sons.  My husband doesn't even want to be around women at work bc he is scared someone might make up some allegation.  THAT is a hostile environment and unfair to men. ||| Yes they should.  But I do understand what you're saying about the true victims and the predicament they are in.  I Just think it's a very sad situation for everyone and it's distressing that this is an issue in our society now. ||| Yes really without any good solution.  People would have to constantly be wearing body cameras to have definitive proof one way or the other, which is absurd. ||| Yeah, no doubt.  Maybe the next generation can see some improvement if parents work to teach them better when they are young.  I don't know. ||| You and me both.  Well thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you have a good day.  goodbye ||| What did you think about this? ||| You think they should have just automatically believed her? ||| I disagree, what if they assumed all allegations against men were true? ||| I think you have to be neutral until you gather facts.  if you assume guilt, what does that do to the accused if later it is found they were innocent?? ||| that analogy is not the same bc it is not potentially ruining someone's life and reputation, but anyhow I don't want to have a debate bc we clearly disagree and I am not going to change my mind.  as far as the article, it did seem he is probably guilty in this case.  I feel bad for the woman ||| yep and she had to sit on it for so long ||| I wondered the same.  maybe she was scared bc he was powerful?  or didn't want to mess up her career? what do you think ||| yeah it would definitely be an uncomfortable position to be in for sure, it's good she finally came forward ||| yes! he was clearly abusing his power in a grotesque way ||| they really can.  it is so disgusting and sad.  well i hope you have a good day, I gotta go.  bye! ||| Well I thought this was a little sad.  Like, weren't the family even looking for this person? ||| yeah I considered that, too.  Did the article mention how long it's been ||| yeah so maybe the family will realize soon and come locate her.  I hope. ||| I am sorry to hear that, I know it can be very difficult for family members. ||| That is what I have heard about the family.  That's so sad.  My husband's grandmother had alzheimers and passed away last year.  It was very hard on their family too. ||| Oh yeah, that would be amazing.  It would really impact a lot of families for sure ||| Oh true, I did not notice that.  That is horrible.  I'm always reading stories of abuse and negligence in these facilities.  That's unforgivable. ||| I would say that's definitely possible.  how sad ||| YEah I have seen those stories too!  Preying on a highly vulnerable population ||| Yes, for sure.  It would just add to the feelings of guilt.  Well thank you for sharing your feelings with me, have a great day!  goodbye ||| What did you think of it? ||| yeah exactly how it made me feel!  it is sad to see such decline ||| yeah I have noticed that to, why do you think that is? ||| maybe so, or maybe just a breakdown of family, I really don't know.   probably a combination of many factors.  people are too busy to deal with it. ||| yeah that's a good point, too.  It's a lot to swallow.  my grandfather is 98 and needs constant care, it's really hard on my mom ||| yeah it is pretty sad, his wife died two years ago, they had been married since they were 18 and sweethearts since age 14 or so.  really sad. ||| yeah I guess so.  I think it gets rough at a certian point, like are people even meant to live that long? ||| yeah same here ||| yeah I agree, it seems people get so miserable ||| No, it is not at all.  well I must go, nice talking to you.  bye! ||| Yeah I found the numbers staggering too.  Plus the death toll were shockingly high. ||| I don't know anything about the deal with Turkey, fill me in? ||| ahhh gotcha.  Maybe some form of heightened border patrol?  Good question. ||| Yeah definitely!  And it doesn't seem like it will be getting better anytime soon. ||| Yeah no doubt,  That's the million dollar question.  I guess it's just really sad for all the innocent victims like the kids ||| Yeah and if it has an impact on relationships, like are people scared to get close to each other bc you can lose people so easily ||| Yeah, how very tragic.  I guess it makes me grateful to live in this beautiful country ||| Yeah that would be interesting to see!  Like does it affect their willingness to have more children ||| Well there are so many horrendous parents out there, it is sometimes astonishing so yeah, I agree ||| I was also shocked by that!  Like, what the heck!?!?  That will surely have an impact on their economy.  Well I gotta run, it's been great chatting with you.  Have a great weekend.  bye! ||| No, not really.  I didn't care for her or the Clintons so there is that.  I'm sorry for the loss of a life and the loss for the loved ones left behind I suppose.  How about you? ||| Yeah it is always interesting to read.  I agree with that for sure. ||| hahaha.  I find anyone associated with the Clintons to be distasteful but whatever, at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal to me. ||| yeah it is really hard to like any of them!  hard to conjure up sympathy for sure ||| lol no I seriously doubt they would.  I think most of what they do is just an act put on for the public.  It is definitely interesting to read about though. ||| I was young during the whole Janet Reno era too, I just remember her name being mentioned at the time.  Some of the things the article mentioned were disturbing. ||| haha I Never saw that show before, but I know what it is.  I'm sure Parkinson's is probably an unpleasant way to go. ||| and I'm always sad for the family when things like that happen ||| I'm very sorry to hear that ||| and you as well, bye! ||| What did you think of this? ||| Yes, I totally agree.  I did not like her or  her politics, but I have sympathy for anyone who went through that disease as well as their family ||| yeah haha you and me both.  But I am trying to muster some sympathy.  maybe for the family. ||| Yeah it was biased.  I try to keep up with politics but I'm not fanatical.  Either way, I know enough to know she does not endorse the same things I do.  So maybe I am biased too. ||| haha omg I think me too!!  well I may have seen a few others but this is one of the top for sure. ||| hahaha I was too.  No, hardcore Clinton hater here.  sorry not sorry ||| Me too!!!  Are they so blind?  It seriously shocks me.  It is infuriating. ||| Yeah I guess I should.  I feel like the news is partly to blame bc it is so biased but people should know better ||| Yes they really are, and people seem to believe whatever they read.  It is sad really ||| hahaha you are funny.  I am the same way!!  well thanks for the talk, it has truly been a pleasure.  have a good day, bye! ||| I found this to be quite tragic.  Any incident like this is just terrible, especially for the families and people involved. ||| Yeah, it just goes to show how many lives are impacted when something like this happens.  It just seems like it happens all too frequent nowadays.  It's terrible. ||| Yeah totally, me too.  That impacted me the most out of the entire article.  As a mother of four, that's just the ultimate tragedy for a parent.  I\m so sad for him."" ||| Yeah, just like in the situation in Las Vegas in the USA.  That concert where so many people were killed.  I can't imagine the band or artist playing wouldn't feel somehow guilty. ||| Wouldn't it?  Like crouched in some area not knowing if you'll make it out alive or not.  That's so sad too. ||| Oh yeah, no doubt.  It would be traumatizing probably for the rest of their lives. ||| Yeah that's a really good point.  Like they should have done something else to signify the fact that a tragedy happened there for the survivors maybe. ||| Yeah, did they mention what those powers specifically were?  Perhaps they were following the lead of the U.S. ||| Yeah probably so.  Things like that seem to follow mass tragedies like this. ||| Hopefully you are right.  I think we must remain vigilant.  Hope you enjoy your day, goodbye ||| yeah his story was truly heartbreaking.  can you imagine ||| yeah those were the two main things that stood out to me too.  The fear, it's just unimaginable. ||| yeah it would almost feel like it was your fault wouldn't it.  ugh. ||| I really hope so.  when was the last one on american soil? ||| yeah that is exactly what i was thinking ||| San Bernardino I think.  but yeah, hopefully it is dying down.  it is the domestic incidents that are still a major concern here ||| maybe so, that is an interesting perspective ||| seriously.  I don't even like going to crowded places anymore. ||| I don't know.  I think there are more shooting victims than powerball winners, but either way I don't like crowds to start with so it's not like I'm sacrificing something I love. ||| Yeah it is just not appealing.  I'd rather be home with my family and close loved ones.  Well it has been good talking to you, have a good day!!  bye ||| Well this article just made me really grateful to be an American.  The horrors those people are enduring are truly outlandish. ||| Yeah, it is just needless and senseless suffering and loss of innocent human lives.  The ultimate tragedy really ||| Yeah, no doubt.  How do these people sleep at night?  It's gotta be an entirely different cultural mindset, I just can't even fathom it. ||| I'm sure they do, it's just so ridiculous and crazy to me that other human beings can function and behave this way. ||| Yeah it is.  It seems quite primitive really.  The mindset, the behaviors, all of that. ||| Is it effective?  How so?? ||| Yeah but effective for what?  I don't see anything positive happening over there or getting accomplished, and like you said the aggressors must know this is a fight they can't win.  Everybody loses. ||| Ehh, I still think it's an ineffective and pointless thing.  It's been going on for as long as history can even record with no real resolution or accomplishment.  It's just a failed endeavor. ||| I reckon so.  I personally see it as totally pointless and ineffective and truly an atrocity against humans. ||| Most human people, however, would see it as a monstrosity.  Have a good day, goodbye. ||| I found it kinda hard to connect to this article.  It's defiitely sad for the families involved. ||| Yeah seriously, like as long as I can remember.  It's just sorta a constant thing.  The way they described it, it sounds like a problem without much solution really. ||| YEs exactly, like they are just spinning their wheels.  And I'm sorry if this sounds bad but I don't particularly think we can afford to keep accepting more and more and more refugees. ||| Yeah exactly, and it feels like we and a few other countries are the only ones taking refugees and trying to help.  I don't know, I'm uninformed about the situation.  That's just how it seems to me. ||| Yep, exactly.  There is no good solution.  I do feel sad for people like the children involved and families though.  But what can I do. ||| Oh yeah, it's ridiculously bad over there.  I just feel grateful I live in America. ||| Yes!  Me too!  Like, what the heck?  That would be so awful on so many levels.  Ugh! ||| Right? Is there nothing positive to report?  Perhaps not?  I don't even like watching movies that are set over there.  Just too depressing. ||| Yes it is always some tragedy.  There must be normal people living mundane lives there I would think?  I really don't know. ||| Yes, if we're being honest I really get sick of hearing people complain about the USA.  My mom is really bad about it.  We may have our (major) problems, but honestly it doesn't even compare to some of these other places.  I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye ||| I found this article obnoxious.  What were your thoughts on it? ||| It attempted to blame an increase in hate crimes (which it later retracted, saying they were likely at the same level as they were in 2015) on Trump. ||| Those are my exact sentiments.  It is a mindset that has entered society and is probably exacerbated by social media and the rapid exchange of information, ideas, hatred, and anger that is prevalent in society today.  To blame it on Trump, one person, is just absurd. ||| Yes, and there have been a large number of terrorist incidents that were perpetrated by Muslims.  So to me, that would explain why people are targeting Muslims in retaliation.  Which is not right at all, but it is the explanation for why that is happening. ||| You make a good point.  That is probably an idealistic notion that is not grounded in reality.  I do wish people would learn to live and let live a little bit more.  Just mind their own business and enjoy their lives. ||| Yes and social media probably feeds into that.  Not to keep blaming social media for all our problems because I certainly don't think that's the case, but I Do think it heightens the issue you are describing.  People see differences and inequalities and just have much more information than they did in the past. ||| Yeah it definitely becomes compulsive for people, like an integrated and critical part of their lives almost.  Something did not really happen unless it's documented on social media.  Kinda crazy to me, but whatever.  Either way, I do think it is intensifying a lot of these problems and it will definitely be interesting to see what happens over the next century. ||| It is a very strange phenomenon.  And it has happened so fast.  It's crazy to think when I was a kid the only phones we had were in the house, and the computer was basically just a very simple word processor.  My kids can't even fathom it.  We used a phone book to look up a phone number. ||| Yeah I don't even know where I would get a phone book.  They don't distribute them where I live.  I have a cell phone but it stays off on a shelf unless I leave the house.  It is for emergency use when I am out. ||| LOL apparently I am not either.  But I am perfectly fine with that.  This is how I choose to live my life.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye ||| yeah me too.  Really heartbreaking, all these kids suffering.  And their parents feeling helpless ||| yeah I bet it is bad.  I read another article on here about how animals at the Venezuelan zoo were starving to death, and people were slaughtering horses to eat and to feed animals.  It's really bad down there. ||| yeah no doubt.  I think their economy is one of the worst in the world, and they have an extreme political situation, too.  Isn't it some sort of horrible dictatorship? ||| yeah I am not informed about all that, I just know their situation is dire. ||| I just remember learning in Economics class in graduate school that they had a serious hyper-inflation issue, to the extent that they were paying the workers several times a day bc their checks would be worthless by the end of the day otherwise.  that way they could take money home to the wives andt hey could go buy food.  ridiculous.  apparently not much has changed. ||| that's so crazy to try to wrap my head around.  I am SO grateful to be an American, seriously. ||| yeah no doubt!  Outraged when they are out of the english muffins I like. ||| yeah I try to remind my kids that when they say they are \starving\"" but I know they can't even fathom what I'm talking about"" ||| yeah, which is understandable.  How can you learn if you're literally starving?  so sad. ||| you too, bye ||| Wow, really?  I thought it was very sad.  They didn't give many details in the story though. ||| Awww poor guy.  What was up with the domestic violence charge, though?  That made me not feel much compassion for him. ||| Yeah I mean if he was a veteran, clearly he has been through a lot and was suffering.  However, I still find it hard to have sympathy for anyone who hurt their children.  Why harm them?  They are innocents.  There were other chioces he could have made to cope with what he was going through, which I\m sure was a lot."" ||| Yeah for sure, I agree with your assessment and I agree it is still hard to have sympathy for this man. ||| that's exactly what I said in the paragraph.  I feel so bad for her, she lost her entire family.  Can you imagine. ||| yeah for sure, and she's left to pick up the pieces and deal with that.  did we talk friday afternoon?? I feel like we have been paired before. ||| just the way you write your responses.  I've done a ton of them too.  anyhow, hopefully she can find the support and strength she needs to rebuild her life.  I don't think I would be able to. ||| Yeah you would definitely need a good support network.  People are certainly resilient but this woman lost everything.  So very tragic. ||| I'm sorry for your loss.  It can definitely be permanently life altering to lose someone  dear to you. ||| I hope you have a great day, too!  bye! ||| Yeah I don't either.  It's always distressing to read about angry mobs attacking a person. ||| I don't think the animals should be killed for no good reason, like just to take their horns and sell them for example.  Only if the entire animal is being used for meat, food, etc. like it should be.  They didn't give many specifics about that in this story.  How do you feel about it? ||| Yeah I mean in some cases it is understandable.  I think it is a cultural thing that I don't know much about as far as Africa goes.  It's easy for me to sit here in the comfort of my living room and judge but I Don't really know what life is like there. ||| yeah certainly that is a part of our history. ||| I have no idea about that. ||| Well sex tends to sell in general, so yeah.  But it is most likely a bogus claim no doubt. ||| Yeah that's kinda sad.  Preying on people's vulnerabilities. ||| What exactly do you mean by the rest of the world should pay? ||| Hmm, I disagree.  I think we have enough problems in our own country to be trying to solve other country's issues, but if people want to donate they are always free to do that.  I don't think it should be cursory though.  That would be infuriating. ||| Yes, I agree with that.  I think there are foundations that exist where you can do that if you would like to support that cause.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye ||| This was very sad.  55 civilians killed?  that's crazy. ||| yeah it must have been ||| yeah seriously.  It seems like so much needless killing, like those were 55 innocent people with lives, personalities, etc. ||| yeah exactly.  u.s. troops died too but they kinda went into things knowing that could happen ||| yeah kinda hard to say.  I don't know much about all that. ||| yeah I am inclined to say we should not get involved but I think it is way, way too late for that ||| yeah exactly ||| Yeah I hear that.  I think there is no really good answer to it all, I mean innocent people will end up dying regardless.  Just very sad in general ||| Yeah I agree.  There is no good solution, it ||| Yeah I totally agree.  Is it possible we are just making things worse?  Anyway, it has been great speaking with you.  I hope you enjoy your day, goodbye ||| What did you think of this article? ||| Well yeah, 30 civilians died.  I think it was very sad.  These people are caught up in this ridiculous conflict. ||| Hey, with all due respect, would you mind responding a little bit faster?  The HIT will expire if there is so long between responses and it makes it hard to have a conversation.  :)  Anyway, yes it seems like such senseless killing.  I can't imagine how the people living there must feel. ||| Internet issues are a drag.  Yes me too, it makes me very grateful to be an American when I read things like this. ||| YEah seriously, you would think we would be past this.  Plus, that war has been going on since the beginning of time it seems ||| Yeah and honestly I don't even understand it. ||| Yeah exactly!  I mean, I get that it has to do with oil, and terrorists, but it seems like there's more to it.  Regardless, what terrible luck to be born there. ||| Right?  I can't imagine worrying about being blown up each day ||| OMG right?!  It's unimaginable. ||| Yeah I was thinking the same, and my kids are everything to me.  So that's saying a lot.  But it would be too scary, just the thought of something happening to them every day.  Ugh.  Unbearable.  Well it has been great talking to you, I hope you have a great day!  bye ||| Well, I had mixed feelings about this.  What did you think? ||| Yes exactly my thoughts!!  I feel bad for them too, but who is supposed to be funding their care ||| Yeah totally.  It is unreasonable to expect really.  Again, who would pay for it?  Taxpayers?  that's not really fair. ||| yes very true.  I googled and it said a lot from that camp were from syria and surrounding areas ||| Yeah it was in france in 2015-6, and the majority were from syria and two other countries I have not  heard of ||| Eritrea and Somalia.  I had forgotten, sorry.  But yeah, you totally do have to be very careful.  And this might be horrible to say, but I would imagine the conditions were still better than those they came from. ||| that was my thinking, too. ||| I feel like it is the truth.  Google claims the camp began to grow, with migrants from iraq and afghanistan showing up.  Then things like fights and violence began to break out amongst the people.  it apparently became a big problem. ||| No, you don't sound bad.  I agree.  I don't understand what is going on over there.  It all seems so negative. ||| Yes that's a great example.  It just seems backwards and irrational, and inhumane.  Anyway, I am very grateful to be an American in the USA.  It has been a pleasure speaking with you, I Hope you have a great rest of your day.  goodbye ||| Well, I think we need more information.  I read a different article about the Calais camp and it gave a different story.  The refugees were apparently causing problems there, and it got out of hand.  I don't really know what to think.  I feel sad for children who suffered.  What did you think? ||| Yeah no it did not.  It seemed a bit biased to me.  But regardless, it certainly sounds like the situation got out of hand.  The camp couldn't be supported and there wren't enough resources there.  I know it became a big problem for the French government.  They had to clear it all out. ||| Yes, that was my take on it too.  They cleared the camp out!  It was causing too many problems. IT took several attempts and the refugees protested, burned things, threw rocks, etc., the typical rioting behavior.  But eventually they were put out and I think most went to other countries or areas and carried on. ||| yes that was my thoughts ||| I think I may have encountered a few that seemed biased.  I actually read another article on here about Calais camp and it was a little less biased.  It certainly didn't use the word \abusive\""."" ||| Yes I think it is sad for the kids, too.  innocents.  they kinda made it out like it was just a bunch of kids, though.  accoring to another article it was 62% med aged 33 on average ||| It would be terrible, and the other article said a lot of the children were unaccompanied, so where were the parents?? ||| yeah that would be very sad, I guess it is possible ||| Yeah good point, that is equally tragic.  Well I must go, thanks for the talk!  bye ||| it has to be lowercase unfortunately ||| bye! ||| Hi! What did you think of the article? ||| yeah for sure, it's outlandish that that is even happening this day in age ||| Exactly!  what the heck.  so sad for the people there, like what options do they even have? ||| oh yeah, I think they are one of the most corrupt there is, and the whole nation is rife with problems ||| yeah along with maybe venezuela ||| I'm grateful to live here every single day of my life.  We really struck the lottery being Americans. ||| seriously.  It honestly annoys me to hear people complaining so much about america.  I get that we have our issues, but you have plenty of food and can express your opinion freely and walk around without worrying about  being bombed randomly all the time. ||| yeah they probably make more in an hour  than those people do in a day or a week ||| yeah that's my feelings for sure.  oh and north korea too ||| yeah it is!! well it's been great talking to you, have a good afternoon!  bye ||| Well I thought this was a very avoidable tragedy.  What did you think? ||| Yeah, it was just totally helpless in the car to suffer. ||| Yeah for sure, I do.  It was an accident but she should have known and remembered the dog was there.  she was resonsible for it.  what do you think? ||| Yeah maybe reprimanded and banned from handling any more dogs ||| Yeah no doubt, I don't have dogs but still I would think it's like your children, like you need to know when they're with you or not ||| Yeah totally, what is up with people leaving living beings in their cars!? ||| It is absolutely crazy!  It's like there's a story or more every single week ||| Yeah sometimes there are ||| I would have called 911, how about you ||| lol I hear you, I'm pregnant and have a baby, two toddlers, and another child so I don't really want to be smashing glass right now but I'd definitely call for help ||| You too, have a great day, bye! ||| What did you think about the article? ||| I was a little unclear on a few things.  Why exactly was the government sniper out there shooting the wolf, did you catch that? ||| I really am not sure.  Like if he had a valid reason, like maybe the wolves were terrorizing the public or threatening people then I could understand it.  If he was just randomly there shooting wolves for fun that seems uncool. ||| Yeah it does, and a wolf seems like a random thing to want to kill for fun.  You can't even eat the meat. ||| Well maybe you can eat it?  I've never heard of people eating it, though.  Like people where I Live hunt dear for fun and eat the meat. ||| It's huge where I live.  I am ok with it if there is a purpose and it is a species like deer that is very populous and needs control.  And you're going to eat the meat and use the parts.  Hunting just to kill things like a giraffe for a trophy or an endangered species is unacceptable to me.  What do you think? ||| Yeah I think that is terrible too.  And post these pictures of it online glorifying their kill.  How sick. ||| Yeah I think I remember the one you are referencing.  It made national news. ||| Legislation would have to be changed.  There would need to be laws banning that type of hunting for sport.  I would support something like that, although it would be very difficult to categorize all the different types of animals.  What do you think ||| Yeah I can't see that ever passing.  Well it has been interesting talking to you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye ||| what did you think about this situation? ||| what do you mean? ||| I disagree, I think we have many options every day to control our own fate ||| Yes I am.  I'm not sure how you think one's options shrink the older they get, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion too.  So what did you think about the man in the article? ||| I disagree about indoctrination.  We have the freedom to chose our role in the United States of America, unless perhaps you are speaking of a different culture?  Regardless, that is not at all my reality of that or anyone I know, but perhaps it is yours. ||| You sound like an intoxicated person to me.  I don't feel much empathy towards him.  He had a rough childhood, but he has had personal responsibility for himself since the age of 18 and he made poor choices.  He could have made sure his papers were correct and up to date.  That was his responsibility.  He chose to break the law, repeatedly.  What do you think about him? ||| Yep, maybe so ||| No ||| They are legal citizens ||| No, it clearly stated that if you read the article.  Goodbye! ||| Wow, that is just crazy.  What did you think ||| Yeah no doubt.  It sounds like justice will be served but it's sad things like this even happen ||| Yeah seriously!!  Maybe a combination of childhood experiences, poor choices, and some sort of biochemistry.  I do not know. ||| yeah that too ||| not really.   I'd like to say yes but I think humans habe done horrible things to other humans for all time,  what do you think ||| lol you may be right ||| Yeah, an animal like drive of some sort ||| yeah definitely not something I will ever understand ||| You and me both.  do you have any ideas that might help? ||| Yeah I think you are on the right track with that.  Well I hope you have a good day, nice talking to you.  much better than the last person I had to talk  to.  goodbye! ||| So what did you think of this? ||| No, I do not.  I would feel guilty going to a circus.  I might go to a zoo if it were a nice one.  We have a great one near where I live  What about you? ||| yeah I doubt it.  I would feel guilty paying money to watch animals parade around like that.  I think they are cruel to them. ||| yeah seriously, it's totally inhumane and they have no say so in it.  I think they should shut them all down.  Zoos, if properly maintained, I think can give animals a safe and natural habitat and children can really learn from them. ||| yeah that's terrible!  poor girl.  Elephants are intelligent and sensitive too ||| oh yeah, I have no desire to do that but I'm sure it would be really interesting and quite an experience. ||| that is very altruistic of you, maybe you could find financing for it?  Do the groups that sponsor it not help with the expenses? ||| You sound like a very caring person.  Maybe that church will one day be able to finance a project in Africa. ||| I can imagine it is very different than what we would expect.  That's greaet that you have had that experience ||| I would think so.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you have a great day and I hope that one day you can accomplish that dream of yours.  Don't stop trying!  bye ||| Yeah it did seem very sad to me.  I was a little confused by all the politics but it was clear a lot of people were really suffering. ||| Yes, in Kenya and South Sudan ||| Wow, that's wild.  Mine was about a government official from South Sudan being deported from Kenya, and a bunch of murder and rapes going on in Kenya.  I have had the Halloween article before so I know what you're talking about, though.  That one was defiitely very hard to read.  Probably the saddest I've ever read on here. ||| Yes, that's what I was thinking we could do.  This is definitely bizarre, never had this happen.  Anyhow, yeah the fact that this had happened to that family twice is unthinkable.  What on earth.  So sad. ||| Yeah, was there any mention of any factors that contributed to the accident?  That's one thing I could not remember. ||| I guess it would have mentioned if alcohol or drugs were involved or anything like that.  Regardless, it doesn't make it any less sad or tragic. ||| Yeah you are probably right about that.  It is also horrific that they were out trying to have fun on a special night.  And all the kids.  Just heartbreaking. ||| Yep, I must strongly agree with you on that.  I would never put my kids in a trailer or the back of a truck or anywhere but buckled safely into their seats, that seems very reckless. ||| Yep, same.  I wonder if the driver of the truck pulling the trailer was also held responsible somehow.  I'm sure they felt terrible. ||| I would think so, which is sad but she did put them in danger, sadly.  Well it has been nice speaking with you.  What an odd circumstance here.  Have a great day, goodbye ||| I support the ban, but I have four children and I've literally had to leave playgrounds before because people were blowing smoke everywhere.  I thought the argument about it setting a bad example was stupid, though. ||| I mean I honestly can go either way.  It's not something I'm passionate about or would sit around arguing in favor of.  I just think it's a good idea bc people smoking at playgrounds irritates me.  I hate secondhand smoke.  But whatever, I guess at the end of the day if it bothers you so much you can leave the playground. ||| yeah, I can see that too.  But children's playgrounds are made for kids.  Like, an adult has no  business smoking there.  Maybe step to the parking lot and smoke? ||| Yeah, zoos and parks not so much.  It still annoys me for people to smoke there, but that's a public space.  so there's that. ||| No doubt, I'm with you on that.  Vaping I do not want done around me because apparently these things have a way of blowing up in people's faces. ||| Yeah for sure!  I think 8 deaths recorded so far?  The whole thing is blowing up. ||| How so? ||| Yeah, that's really unfortunate for the people who legitimately need medicines.  Even when I have had surgery, it is practically impossible to get enough medicine after the surgery so I can only imagine how you feel.  So ridiculous. ||| Yeah, I hear your argument for sure.  But there is also the point of respecting children's right not to breathe secondhand smoke.  Let's just say only in areas that are made specifically for kids. ||| Yeah, no doubt.  But I totally get your point about when it only affects yourself, it's your choice. I can get behind that.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye ||| Yeah, that's kinda crazy to thik about ||| Yeah, that seemed to be the main issue they were highlighting. ||| Maybe so, or some sort of better infrastructure to solve the water issue ||| Yeah, definitely.  Maybe that would save them money in the long run on money spent on health issues ||| Yeah for sure!  The wealthy elite are probably living in palaces with pristine water. ||| Yeah, it seems like there;s always a huge disparity between rich and poor in these corrupt countries ||| yep exactly!  And I don't think much can be done from an outside perspective.  they have to fix their own problems. ||| Yep, I don't think we should waste our funds on that ||| Yeah we do!  WE need to spend our money there, not in other corrupt countries ||| You are so right.  It could be right around the corner, would not be shocking at all.  well I must go, it has been nice talking to you.  goodbye ||| Ugh I just think it's so sad every time I hear of some senseless shooting like this.  It's always some lunatic with a gun who's angry at the world or emotionally unstable and takes it out on others.  So insane.  What did you think? ||| definitely more unstable ||| what about it do you think? ||| I don't think so, this is happening in many other countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, too.  Sometimes it is knives or machetes instead of guns but the same premise of some lunatic just massacreing other people for no apparent reason ||| I'm not sure, I haven't seen any data supporting that but perhaps you have some.  Regardless, it is happening too much anywhere. ||| http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/  This says the US is actually number 66 on the list of mass shootings per capita ||| Per capita would be the relevant statistic.  But regardless, it is clear that it is a problem in many countries, not just the U.S.  It is a global issue. ||| What did you think of the man in the article? ||| how so? ||| Well you have a great day, I gotta go.  bye! ||| What did you think of this? ||| yeah, those poor eight children and his wife, too.  I think the whole situation over there is senseless honestly. ||| seems like nothing ||| I don't know about that, tell me? ||| It seems like that would just make the conflict worse, no?  How could it improve things? ||| It seems like both approaches just make things worse ||| I reckon it depends.  SOmetimes it does, sometimes it does not.  It just seems like this one has been going on far too long.  Regardless, it is very sad for all the civilians and innocent victims who have to live in fear every day. ||| That's why it irritates me when people complain about America like it is so bad.  We have it so good here and should be grateful. ||| Yep, exactly.  It is sad, really. ||| Yes, it is a mystery really.  I must go, take care.  bye ||| Hi, what did you think of this? ||| I agree!  So sad!  and what a random, terrible event. ||| yeah they said either lightning striking or something else ||| oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me. ||| Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything. ||| No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to. ||| hahaha no just bc I'm not into sports but my mom and my sister both went there.  are you a fan? ||| nice!  I know nothing about either one but it sounds like it was a fun experience.  Anyhow, I think the article said there were a ton of lives lost, what was it like 19 people or was it more? ||| wouldn't it?  geez yeah, must have been painful and terrifying all in one. ||| oh yeah, I can't either.  I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me. ||| yeah you too!  have a good one, bye! ||| Yeah, it would be really rough, but what a miracle that everyone survived. ||| Yes!  It would be absolutely horrible to lost your home and all your possessions, but such a blessing that at least they have each other.  I think only one person was even in the hospital. ||| Yeah, I gathered the injuries must not have been that bad ||| Yeah good point, that seems contradictory.  But you're right, it must not have been too serious if they just treated them there and let them go. ||| Oh yeah, I do not like that either.  I burn myself all the time cooking for some reason.  Burns really hurt, can't imagine having a more serious one. ||| It was very vague and short.  I do not remember if it said they were burned or not.  I'm assuming so, would have to be either that or smoke inhalation probably? ||| yeah I took it the same way.  They definitely did not go into much detail.  Didn't mention the cause of the fire either, did they? ||| Oh yeah good point, to prevent additional fires. ||| Yeah, that is so vague.  It was just like a news snippet really ||| Yeah true that!  It could really go either way.  Well it has been great talking to you, I must go.  hope you have a good day, goodbye ||| I thought it was sad just due to the massive loss of life, what did you think? ||| Yes seriously, these mines are too dangerous ||| Yep, sounds so typical.  Putting profits over the lives of humans ||| Yeah, I was feeling awful for the families.  They all lost a husband, a father ||| Yep, exactly!!!  That is just terrible. ||| Yes, although I would say it seems unlikely.  It seems like these things tend to go unpunished, like the factories in INdia that collapse and kill hundreds of workers ||| Yeah, it seems especially bad in certain countries ||| Yes, and there is always so much corruption amongst those in power ||| Yeah, that is the ultimate tragedy right there ||| I'm sure they are.  What a horrible thing to go through.  Well it has been nice speaking to you, I must go.  goodbye ||| So this was clearly a sad situation, although I am glad they have caught the guy.  What did you think? ||| yeah no doubt, and probably even more than they know about ||| Yeah the famous athletes always seem to get a free pass. ||| yes seriously  disgusting really ||| I think it's ridiculous, just a diversion tactic.  What did you think ||| Yeah, he is just trying to politicize the issue ||| No doubt!!!  At such a young age.  And probabloy way more women than that ||| I am really not sure.  I guess awareness is a big thing.  What do you think?? ||| Oh yeah, I am sure that plays a big role.  These kids are clearly way too young to be drinking, they need better enforcement of the laws ||| I strongly agree, and I used to drink a lot.  I quit, but I think it is very harmful, especially for young adults and kids, which these 18 year olds are ||| Yeah exactly, frontal lobe is still developing.  That's a pretty critical part of the brain.  Well I must go, it has been good speaking with you.  goodbye ||| OMG, this was absolutely heartbreaking.  What did you think of it? ||| I mean the horror the boy must have felt, and then the horror of the family, it's just crazy ||| I can't even imagine, it's unthinkable.  I guess the well was in the yard?  Did it say? ||| Yeah, that is just terrible.  And how scared he must have been. ||| Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detail ||| Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.  Do you remember how far down it said he was?  WAs it like 400 ft? ||| That is insane.  I am claustrophobic so just the thought of that induces panic.  That poor boy. ||| I do not remember seeing his age, but he must have been quite small to fit in a space that small.  Yeah no doubt, it is having the same effect on me.  I have four children and three are just babies, I am about to tear up too.  This is crazy. ||| Yeah seriously, like worst moment of their lives ||| Yeah me too.  Probably one of the two worst articles I've read on here.  Well I hope you have a good rest of your day, it's been good talking to you.  goodbye ||| Wow, what did you think of this? ||| Me too, it was genuinely heartbreaking.  Can you imagine? ||| Me too, I could never recover.  It must have been so scary too for the boy. ||| Yeah just doing an everyday mundane task.  Four days is a long time, too!! ||| Yes that is a sad fact of life ||| nothing like this, what about you? ||| right, same here.  I've certainly done stupid things but nothing so traumatizing ||| oh yeah, I have four children and one more on the way, it's my biggest fear in life.  I cant even talk about it.  what kind of dog do you have ||| yeah I totally get that too now.  I'm an over protective mother but they are e verythiing to me. ||| I do too.  I'm sure it will be very rough for them, ugh ||| you too! bye ||| It's outrageous.  There is really no excuse, if people feel the need to have these drugs around they need to keep them locked up or really high in a cabinet away from children, same as you would treat a loaded gun ||| It's crazy.  There was some woman in the news a few days ago who was giving heroin to her one year old every night to help her sleep.  It killed the baby. ||| What is WRONG with people?!?  I have four kids, three are babies, and it is incomprehensible to me that someone would even consider doing something like that!!!!  Sure they wake up at night, sometimes multiple times, but that's part of having a child. ||| Yeah this woman was rubbing heroin on the baby's gums each night.  Well she got a batch laced with fentanyl. ||| They do.  It's shocking.  And so unfair to the kids ||| If they do something like that, then yeah.  Because all it would do is put more kids lives in danger if they have more ||| they are. it is so sickening to me.  some guy in the news killed his several month old baby by throwing him on the ground bc he was mad he lost a video game ||| No, but that is the same thing!  like, what the heck!?  and meanwhile there are couples out there just desperate to have a baby who would give these children a loving home.  It's so twisted and messed up and sad. ||| I think God and other good powers are still there, but there's evil that's out there too.  It's always been there, just manifesting in different ways.  There is still a lot of good in the world, too, gotta remember that ||| yeah but I totally get what you are saying, sometimes it really seems that way, especially when you look at some of the awful things people do.  well I must go but I hope you have a really good day full of positive happy things :)  goodbye ||| So what did  you think of this ||| I think it's ridiculous.  As a mother of four, three of whom are under age four, I think it's inexcusable people can't f ind a way to keep their drugs pout of reach ||| yeah but it's still no excuse.  it feels like I read about a baby overdosing almost every week, and the majority of the time the parent is abusing the drugs ||| highly neglectful ||| yeah that could work.  I mean it should be up to the consumer really, b ut if people are going to be so irresponsible then I guess the drug companies doing something is better than nothing.  At least it would protect the poor babies. ||| yeah seriously but the kind of people who are abusing a bunch of opioids and benzos probably aren't paying attention to that anyway or would forget to do it. ||| maybe there are some, but I don't know.  Every case I've read has been a drug user, I\ve never even seen one where it was a legitimate prescription.  I'm sure they exist though.  But being over worked or tired is still no excuse.  I'm constantly overworked and tired and would never forget to secure something that could harm my child.  good grief."" ||| yeah no doubt!  and people need to get a grip on their own behavior.  stop abusing drugs if you're going to be a parent. ||| Yeah really, it's not usually a mother who leaves her children.  His mom tries to come around now and he won't even acknowledge her, she's still messed up.  Well it's been good talking to you, I hope you have a nice afternoon and take care.  bye! ||| Yeah what on earth is wrong with that guy?  Who does something like that? ||| Or just a very sick person, the flamingo was just chilling ||| yes, probably a precursor to behavior against other humans as well ||| yeah that's exactly what I was thinking ||| that is neat!  yeah they are cool, totally undeserving of any sort of abuse like that ||| oh do they eat them or what?  that is good.  I'm scared of ticks. ||| that's great!  birds are fascinating creatures.  that flamingo danced on its own accord which was neat ||| yeah I think so too, they have a lot of similarities.  and some are monogamous which is neat ||| yeah no doubt! ||| yeah no one does anything until it's too late ||| yeah but no one wants to do anything.  Well I must go, it's been nice talking to you, have a good day.  goodbye ||| Well, I thought this was sad for the animals.  But it's one of those situations where there's not much anyone can do.  What was your take on it? ||| What do you think can be done? ||| I agree, I think it's really up to nature which we cannot control ||| My guess would be just natural fluctuations in the weather.  Kinda hard to say.  I guess it could be any number of things really. ||| That could possibly help, I think it would be worth exploring ideas like that.  I wonder if they have? ||| I wonder why they are not doing it there, did it say? ||| Perhaps financial reasons, what do you think? ||| Yeah I don't know much about it but it doesn't seem like a very industrialized, thriving nation ||| hahaha yeah, same.  B ut not much economic news ||| me either, they're like a ghost country ||| Yeah I don't know either.  Are they even a democracy or what?  Anyway, I hope things change, too, for the sake of the animals.  well I must go, it's been nice speaking with you.  goodbye ||| I definitely thought it was sad for the animals although it did not pull at my heartstrings like some of the other stories I have read on here.  What did you think ||| yeah no doubt and they are really helpless victims of the whole thing ||| yes most definitely, and I mean natural causes such as the drought surely play a part but it seems people could do something to help ||| yeah there might be if you looked? ||| yeah that is why I am suspicious of charity.  it seems a lot are wasteful ||| yeah it is sad that that is the case ||| yeah they can't even advocate for themselves ||| I do not recycle either but it is very difficult where I Live.  I try to make up in other ways. ||| well I don't think I'm really making a difference.  I use a lot of plastic bottles.  But anyway, like you I try to be aware of my consumption but it is hard. ||| you too!  bye ||| Yeah, this is pretty heartbreaking to read.  Such a terrible situation without any real valid solution in sight. ||| What moron made that statement?  But yeah, that is really sad.  And the whole area is just constantly in violent conflict it seems. ||| Yeah that is outrageous.  I guess it is these terrorist groups that are causing all this? ||| You are probably right, who are these rebels, though? ||| Oh ok, that makes sense.  I think I hae read the same thing.  Regardless, it doesn't matter to the victims of these tragedies.  It's very unfair to them. ||| Yeah exactly that was really the worst part of all. ||| I did not see that, I can't even bear to watch things like that.  I'm sure it was moving though ||| Yeah your whole life is gone.  I feel so grateful to live in the USA. ||| Yeah, nothing even close to that. ||| No, just that this is terrible.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye ||| This was pretty sad, it's always awful when civilians are caught up in these things ||| yeah it seems that way doesn't it ||| who do you think are the savages in this particular situation ||| yeah, wonder why they think that's the best plan ||| how so? ||| hmm, what makes you think that?  sounds a bit radical to me ||| maybe so, who knows.  I just try to live my simple little life and be happy.  It's unfortunate for these people caught up in the crossfire though ||| 2008 was just a recession, those are a naturally occurring part of an economy.  But back to the article, what did you think about the people being harmed? ||| It is very sad for them.  have a nice day, goodbye ||| Hi there, what did you think of this? ||| yeah I really can't imagine living like that, it must be so stressful ||| yeah, same here, albeit a bit impoverished.  I did not realize there was all this conflict and violence with India and Pakistan ||| no not at all ||| right?  me too!  I get worried about things like getting sick, these people are worrying abuout imminent death ||| yeah totally miserable.  I'm grateful to live in the USA ||| yeah we are truly so lucky ||| so you think Trump's sanctions and the wall are a good thing? ||| YEah I totally agree, I think he is doing a fabulous job.  If only he got the support he needed from the media, what we could do would be incredible ||| Yeah absolutely!  It is maddening.  All he got was a bunch of praise and props.  Well I gotta go, have a great day!  bye ||| Wow, I thought it was absolutely horrifying, what did you think> ||| Yeah, an extremely sick and depraved person.  Seriously must be a serial killer, no doubt. ||| yeah, who needs to be put away.  that is outrageous.  the poor little kitten!!! ||| Right?!  And how helpless it is.  Just unbelievable, ugh I can't even think abut it. ||| It really is, I can't even imagine the mindset of a person like that. ||| yes or even  to call human, so sick.  I'm so disgusted ||| oh I bet, they probably already have ||| yes that would be my guess ||| same here, one of the most striking and disturbing I have read on here.  ugh. ||| yeah me too, it was honestly hard to read.  I don't like to hear about suffering like that. ||| So do I.  it didn't sound like they have any leads though. ||| yeah, you are probably right.  the person will just be free to strike again. ||| same to you, bye ||| I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think? ||| Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this. ||| Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately. ||| yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of others ||| Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neck ||| Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up. ||| Same here, I've been annoyed before but I've always been treated fairly and with decent courtesy. ||| Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid. ||| Yep, we sure do.  You said it better than I.  Well I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| Yes, I thought so too, like a misunderstanding gone terribly wrong ||| Yeah, they probably need to review protocol and make sure everyone is really clear going forward ||| yeah you would think, maybe some sort of oversight?  Quite a serious one. ||| Yeah seriously, you would think they would have known.  there were also three of them ||| yeah, like you would think one would have said something ||| yeah, but why?  just to be defiant?  rogue?  suicidal?? ||| Yeah that would probably make the most sense ||| yes, the article didn't give much resolution ||| me too.  I was left feeling confused.  Well it has been a great talk, goodbye ||| What did you think of the article? ||| Everyone loves to blame Trump for everything.  There have been hate crimes against Jews since the beginning of time.  That is nothing new. ||| The polls spoke for themselves.  Jewish people supported Trump more than they have other Republican candidates in the past.  Really, it's articles like this that perpetuate this whole finger pointing deal towards Trump.  It's stupid. ||| Seriously, people always fail to recognize these things.  Probably because they just read CNN and disregard actual facts.  Oh well, what can you do ||| Yep, that is very very true.  Pretty much everyone I know feels the same way I do though so there's no one's mind to change ||| Same here, conservative rural area.  I couldn't stand living in a big city. ||| I do not blame you.  I grew up in a mid-sized city and it was bad enough, we've been so much happier since we moved out here. ||| Wow, that is great!  I would love to have livestock but that is so much work.  IA lot of our neighbors do.  I have four children and a fifth on the way so they keep me busy.  Anyway, back to the article, in general it just irritated me. ||| You must stay extremely busy!  :)  Yeah, my oldest is 14 and youngest is 7 months, they'll be almost exactly 1 year apart. ||| I totally hear you!!  my three youngest are under 3.  It is definitely much, much better raising them out here, I can't imagine trying to raise a family in a city around all this nonsense.  no way. ||| I bet so!!  you too, have a great day, bye! ||| Hi there, so what did you think of it? ||| who, Putin? ||| oh yeah, he does seem to be trouble.  what did you think of the guy who OD'd? ||| oh maybe so.  I had not thought of that.  I figured he just drank himself to death. ||| yeah you're right, I wouldn't be surprised either ||| yeah what do you think would be best? ||| I know his approval ratings are at an all time low. the public is very unhappy with him in Russia ||| yeah maybe so.  someone there needs to organize something I guess ||| yeah probably so.  I guess they are just stuck ||| yeah it seems so archaic ||| yes unfortunately ||| you too bye"
p030,"I just read an article about how animals in Venezuela are starving to death because of the turmoil that is happening in that country. I feel like there should be some kind of action plan in place for animals in countries that are experiencing hardship so that they can be transported to other places in times of crisis. The thought of innocent creatures starving to death in cages really turns my stomach. ||| I just read an article on melting sea ice in the arctic. It's looking like polar bears are inextricably bound to the fate of extinction. I know they are a popular poster child for environmentalism but there are thirty thousand other species that are being threatened because of humanity's shortsightedness.  ||| I just read an article about China's Yu Xu. She was one of the first female fighter pilots cleared for a solo flight. The state run media is very tight lipped about the cause of the accident and the comments attributed to Yu seem very sterile and highly suspect. She was even compared to Mulan at the end of the article. I just don't know about communist governments. The whole thing seemed like lip service to mask a technical failure. ||| I just read an article about bullying in France. Apparently, the suicide of a 17 year old French girl has caused the country to reevaluate its approach toward bullying. I personally have never experienced intense bullying or ridicule first hand or even second hand. I guess I was a pretty likable kid after all. I think the key to solving problems like this is most definitely inclusion. The reason children feel this way is because they perceive themselves to be absolutely alone. ||| I just read an article about a father and son who fell from a hiking trail and expired. I actually had a friend who met a similar fate a few years ago. He was a ranger in a national park that fell into a crevasse and ended up being eaten by bears. It's a terrible way to shed one's mortal coil. My heart goes out to their family. ||| I just read an article about suicides in children between 10 and 14. Even though I as not aware of the recent spike in these types of fatalities, I am aware that they happen. Years ago when I was visiting my relatives in OK there was buzz around the town about a boy of only 12 that hung himself after he was punished by his father for misbehaving. To think of someone that young taking their own life is absolutely heartbreaking. ||| The things that people do in the name of perversions of faith are absolutely sickening. Religion, something that is used to foster hope, charity and goodwill in the poor and downtrodden is used to exploit and control by those in power. The victims of Boko Haram will most likely see no justice. The rapists, drug dealers and murders will walk free and righteous despite their atrocities. The whole thing makes me sick to my stomach. ||| Just got finished reading an article about the number of refugees who are perishing while trying to traverse the Mediterranean sea on their way from war torn countries. Apparently, the E.U. is still more focused on preventing these people from reaching their shores than they are trying to protect them. Personally, I think that the U.S. and Russia should be taking more than their fair share of these displaced people. ||| I just read an article about the contamination of the Doce river in Brazil. Are there no lengths that man won't go to in order to voice his contempt for nature? An entire river has been rendered fruitless because of man's greed and irresponsibility. Whole livelihoods have been cut short and a once rich and vibrant place has been bathed in the sludge of industry. Why aren't we responding to this kind of thing in an organized fashion? ||| I just read about a tremendous earthquake that happened in New Zealand a few years back. There were only two deaths but the amount of damage to infrastructure was crippling. Do places that fequently deal with natural disasters like this have some kind of insurance or initiative that helps pay for damages? The estimated cost was said to be in the billions. Where does all this money come from? ||| Reading about the atrocities committed by ISIS is one of the most disheartening things a person can do. Children being put on the front lines and brainwashed into thinking that their actions are going to earn them a place in the eternal bliss of paradise while the widows and orphans they create are passed around higher ranking members as slaves. The whole thing makes me want to wretch. ||| So, I just read an article about a baby rhino that passed away in captivity; apparently, due to lack of power? The article was very vague, but the woman describing the situation spoke of the rhino like a member of her family. The whole thing was very touching. It's hard not to have an emotional response to the suffering of any creature. ||| I just read an article about suicides in Russia. Apparently, there are online communities devoted to encouraging teenagers to take their own lives. Often times these websites are maintained and propagated just to receive money through advertising. Can you imagine living with the deaths of people just to make a few bucks from ads? We truly live in a twisted reality. ||| I just read an article about a teenage girl in Russia who was apparently taken in by an online suicide group that conditions teens to kill themselves. It's odd to think that there are people out there that get off on convincing impressionable youth to commit suicide. I think the internet is becoming something that guardians need to at least passively monitor to see what's going on in their children's heads. ||| So, I just read an article about an old woman who seemed to be suffering from dementia found wandering without a coat in the northeast. The police were asking for public assistance to find out where she belonged. It's so sad to think that people in this state can be left alone and have no one to miss them if they wander away. ||| I just read an article about a girl who was about my age who died in the Paris attacks a few years back. This particular story hit closer to home because it focused on a specific person and her family. I can't imagine being roused from my bed to hear that my child has been the victim of a terrorist attack at a show. The whole thing sounds terrible. ||| I just read about a situation in Aleppo where the government sent a mass text to all citizens giving them 24 hours to evacuate before they were potentially targeted by deadly weapons. The thought of receiving a warning like that while you are sitting with your family is just mind boggling to me. What would you do? Where would you go? It's hard to believe people have been living with such violence for such an extended period of time. ||| I just read an article about the islamaphobia resulting from the election of Donald Trump. The man has lowered the bar so far and affected our country so negatively for years to come due to his voracious appetite for appointing judges. I sincerely hope that more people will pay attention to the corruption and need for a radical restructuring of American politics due to his administration. ||| I just read a story about school children in Venezuela that are apparently starving due to the lack of government investment in food programs. The image of school children falling asleep or fainting due to lack of nutrition is just absolutely heart breaking. I can't imagine what the parents must feel having to send their children to school where they will not eat at all. A child can't learn without appropriate nutrition. ||| Just read a story about a father who abducted and then murdered his two sons after being on the run from police. The article didn't give a whole lot of detail, so one has to wonder what drove him to take such drastic action against people who were so close to him. The suspect committed suicide afterward, so I think that it would be considered a crime of passion? Anyway, horribly tragic. ||| I just read an article about a man who was given everything in life, literally. A deluxe apartment, a great job and a position of status in New York society were apparently not enough for him. He was involved in the brutal murder of a man because the man refused his sexual advances. He must suffer from some sort of mental deficiency.  ||| Empathy is not finite. Some people would have you believe that it is, but I think that humans are capable of more than the capitalists would have you believe. I think that I'm going to stop paying attention to the news. It's become a negative force in my life and I think that I would be much happier if I didn't pay attention to American politics ever again.  ||| Sometimes I wonder about the impetus that drives people who murder other people. I think there would be a lot less murder if guns didn't make it so simple. Pulling a trigger. Driving a blade into someone would take a lot more conviction that simply shooting a bullet. I don't know. Have you ever felt like killing another person? ||| Reading about the plight of the Rohingya is always a very sobering experience. Basically, these people are nation-less. They are being persecuted in Burma and forced out of neighboring Bangladesh. I feel like Suu Kyi is being unfairly blamed for a situation that is just too complex for the country to solve effectively. I'm really trying to put myself into the shoes of one of the oppressed Muslim minorities like the Rohingya or the Uyghers and having a very difficult time imagining what a day in their lives must be like. ||| I just read an article about the devastation in Yemen. I think that the alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has been nothing but trouble since we decided to started to lust after their wealth. Millions have been killed or displaced in conflicts that we are either tacitly or actively backing and it looks like there is no end in sight. ||| So, I just read an article about an episode of Dr. Phil that features a young woman who was groomed and sexually abused by both of her parents because of a potential windfall from selling child pornography. I have a hard time wrapping my head around men who abuse their children for sexual gratification, but the fact that her mother was involved in this too makes it almost too horrible to be true.  ||| I just read a story about a Chinese boy who went missing and five days later was found dead at the bottom of a well. Apparently, he had been harvesting vegetables with his father. My question is, if you know that you have a well on your property and your son simply vanishes, wouldn't that be the first place that you look? ||| I just read an article from a couple years ago about the U.S. ranking in comparison to other countries with regard to gender equality. It turns out our backward little country has slipped down to 48th in the international rankings. Am I surprised? No. Will things get worse before they get better? Yes. ||| I just read about a tugboat that spilled a significant amount of oil off the coast of England. There's a lot of talk about automating cars, what about boats? It seems like every little bit we hear about another oil spill that has devastated wildlife and killed a bunch a healthy natural aquatic development. Why does it keep happening? Because people just accept it as a fact of life. ||| I just read an article about instances of red squirrels in the U.K. contracting leprosy. Apparently. there are only three species of mammal on the planet that can actively carry and suffer from the disease, which include: humans, banded armadillos and now red squirrels. I also wasn't aware that it kills nerves throughout your body so that infections can go unnoticed, resulting in amputations of limbs. ||| Just read an article about people being buried alive in Aleppo. The situation in Syria has gotten so out of hand its gotten to the point that you almost want to ignore it for your own mental health. I know the article is dated, but Trump's decision to remove support from our Kurdish allies in Syria is one of the greatest strategic blunders since the instigation of the Iraq war. ||| I just read an article about a kitten that had been brutally bound and left to die on the side of the road in Washington. The article itself was a little too cloying to take very seriously. You know when something is trying a little too hard to tug on your heartstrings and it just has the opposite effect? ||| Just read a story about an incident in Jordan where at least two American soldiers were killed in what appeared to be a mix up. A vehicle carrying American soldiers failed to yield at a gate to an military base in Amman and Jordanian troops ended up opening fire on the vehicle. Apparently, there had been an attack on the base recently, so I can understand why the patrols would be on their toes. ||| Just read an article about a shooting that happened in California. The details were sparse, but apparently a man opened fire with an assault rifle in the public space and only killed one elderly man. Say what you will, but this seems like close to an ideal resolution to a scenario like this. The article then doubled back and said the suspect was still alive despite pronouncing him dead earlier in the text. Odd. ||| So, I just read a story about a family in which the husband and wife were going through domestic strife and the husband ended up murdering everyone and then killing himself. According to the article he attempted to put a band-aid on deeply rooted relationship issues by taking the family to Disney Land. Who thinks like that? Honestly, I can see taking any available route when desperate, but if your wife wants to leave you she is going to leave you. ||| I just read an article about a baseball player who was killed with two other men when his boat crashed at high speed. They really made a concerted effort to paint this guy as a saint and I'm sure that he was a nice enough person, but the circumstances of his death were very mysterious. I wouldn't be surprised if drugs or alcohol were involved. ||| I just read an article about a few siblings who went through the foster system in Kentucky and all ended up in prison for different reasons. Eventually, one of them went on to attain a masters degree and work with people who have to deal with similar circumstances. Unfortunately, I think this story is all too common with children who go through the foster system. ||| I just read an article about the Islamic State's treatment of Christians in Mosul. The more I hear about these militant religious groups the more I think they want to force the timeline of human history backward. I believe their ultimate goal is to unmake thousands of years of human progress so that the most brutal and insensate among us can rule with absolute certainty over those who are not bold enough to challenge them. The seismic shift of politics to nationalism and authoritarianism only reinforces this point. ||| I just read an article about the persecution of the different religious groups in Mosul due to the advance of ISIL and the violence between them and the U.S. backed Iraqi government. It's crazy to think about people's entire lives being destroyed; their homes, businesses, churches every place with any kind of significance is leveled and they have no reason to stay. I honestly don't know why the government is encouraging them to come back. There's nothing to come back to. ||| I just read an article about a toddler that fell from a high rise apartment after his parents left his bedroom window open. I know that people are quick to jump to parental neglect, but sometimes the only way to keep your apartment cool is to keep the windows open. The recent heat waves across the planet have not helped with this at all. You can't help but feel sorry for the poor family. ||| Reading about the violence in Yemen is just emotionally draining. It seems the majority of the casualties are civilians. All of this violence is being spurred on by US backed Saudi violence. I am a firm believer that the US should keep its tendrils out of international conflict. Even when tenuous peace is declared the governments that are installed by US interests are almost destined to fail. ||| I just read an article about MSF putting on simulated refugee experiences across the US. I understand their objective, but I can certainly see this as being a tedious and forced experience. You simply can't simulate the urgency and suffering that refugees have to go through. Your family isn't being rent in twain, your wife isn't being raped and your children aren't being sold into slavery. I know they have the purest intentions, but this just seems silly to me. The people who are attending these events already consider themselves empathetic; they aren't changing any minds with this kind of display. ||| Losing anyone in an accident is a terribly tragic thing, but losing your whole family in one quick flash would be absolutely crippling. I just read about an accident where this exact thing happened to a person. The details were unclear, but it seemed to be caused by the carelessness of another driver. My heart goes out to people who have to live through this kind of tragedy. ||| Do you ever come across an article that you don't intend to read, but end up reading it anyway? That just happened to me. I have no idea why the personal lives of celebrities are of interest to anyone, let alone on the scale that they are marketed to people. I understand that being able to relate to people of higher status gives the dregs of society some kind of validation, but it just isn't for me. ||| Reading about pets dying is never fun. I'm sure that house fires claim the lives of many pets considering the fact that they are physically incapable of opening doors or windows. Should we grieve pets' lives any less than we grieve the lives of humans? My grandparents have a dog that I know they would kill for. ||| I just read an article about how air pollution can shorten life expectancy for those diagnosed with lung cancer. I think that this fact is pretty much a given and shortens life expectancy for just about everyone involved in breathing toxic air. The article was quite impersonal and didn't inspire much empathy for anything except maybe the planet. ||| I just read an article about ranavirus that affects amphibians in the United Kingdom. Apparently, human made garden ponds are contributing to the spread of this virus, but the article seemed wishy washy about how to best deal with the problem. It mentioned that one should not refrain from building garden ponds, but instead refrain from transferring material from said ponds? The whole article kind of missed the mark, I think. ||| A just read a piece about the refugee crisis circa 2016. I'm wondering how many of the one million that Germany promised to provide asylum to are currently living in Germany. I know that this mass migration of refugees is part of the reason for the rise of nationalistic/fascist sentiment in a lot of places. I fear things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. ||| So, I guess I just read a write up on the life of Janet Reno. The whole thing was pretty middling and seemed unbiased. Based on the information presented it seemed like she was an upstanding person, although you can never tell from an article written after someones death. I had heard her name before, but I was a child during the Clinton administration, so I really didn't know who she was until reading this article. ||| Reading about the tactics used by the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria is like being transported back in time. They are destroying resources just to maintain a hold on their positions including using people as human shields. They must be aware that this is a fight they can not win, so instead of giving up they are razing people and cities to the ground. The whole thing is disgusting. ||| Reading about the situation in Syria is always eye opening. It's hard to believe so many people can continue to live in a war zone. The article I read said that a kilo of meat goes for around $40! What do these people eat if there is no food available? It's really hard to wrap my head around. Will the war ever be over? ||| I just read an article about civilian deaths in Afghanistan. There was an incredible amount of focus on the two American soldiers who happened to be blown to smithereens and not the Afghani civilians, but what can you do? I suppose American people are much more interested in their boys fighting an endless war and not the innocent people caught in the crossfire. ||| I just read about an unfortunate wolf that had been tagged by conservationists, wandered away from his pack and murdered by overzealous wildlife exterminators. I wasn't even aware that these types of individuals existed. I knew oil companies employed wildlife exterminators in the far north, but apparently there are people paid to murder animals here in the US. Despicable. ||| I just read an article about a Korean man who was adopted from South Korea when he was three, brutally abused, lived in the U.S. for 37 years and is now being deported because the adoption agency/foster family did not file the correct paperwork for him to get his citizenship. I don't understand how people can sleep at night after persecuting people in unfortunate circumstances like this. ||| I just read an article about an elephant that has been kept in captivity and forced to perform as a circus animal for all its life. Elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures, and I couldn't help but  draw a parallel between the people that are imprisoned in this country. They are also held in cages and forced into indentured servitude. Our whole society is forged and maintained by ostracizing and taking advantage of out groups, humans, animals everything that lives and breathes. ||| I just read an article about a mine collapse in China. Turns out there was a gas explosion and 33 workers were killed. I know that mining is a dangerous profession, but I can't imagine the instant of fear that comes before being incinerated. Then, there families have to wait weeks for their remains to be unearthed. The whole thing is really sad. ||| I'm really not sure why men are so afraid of women in positions of power. My boss is a woman and she does her job effectively and interacts with people with good nature and aplomb. I think that breaking centuries old social norms and structures takes a lot of work that most humans are unwilling to do. It's like self help for an entire species. ||| It seems like every other day you hear about a drone attack in the middle east that has killed innocent people. Frankly, I could care less about the number of American soldiers who are killed in conflicts overseas. They knew what they signed up for and they paid the ultimate price in service of their country. These entire families that are being killed and maimed did absolutely nothing to deserve this kind of treatment. ||| It's amazing to me that you hear more about train crashes than you do about plane crashes. I just read about a train derailment in Spain that killed 50 people. The way it was described is that the train started swaying and just didn't stop until it was on its side. I can't imagine the dread that must have come over people as each sway became more pronounced. Terrifying. ||| I just read an article about the amount of food that Americans waste. I knew that it was high, but I never imagined the numbers that people have been putting up for the last few years. Did you know there are people who refuse to eat leftovers? What kind of first world dystopia do we live in where people won't eat food that isn't straight out of the kitchen? ||| I just read a story about an apparent murder suicide in which the husband of a family of five killed his wife, three children and their dog. Their marriage was apparently going through a rough spot after having a child with a congenital heart defect and the husband just couldn't bear the thought of living without his wife. They seemed relatively happy on the exterior. It just goes to show that you can never really know what is going on behind the scenes. ||| I just read an article about the amount of lead in American water. Apparently. the problem goes beyond the situation in Flint, Michigan. I think that in the coming years the availability of clean water is going to be severely restricted. People are going to be migrating from all over just to get closer to untainted aquifers.","and at such a young age too. ||| yeah, they didn't really elaborate on what happened though ||| more or less, most people can't throw 94 mph fast balls though. ||| seemed to be a pretty altruistic guy too. There wasn't anything but goodwill toward him. ||| hm, i wouldn't know. Do you follow baseball? ||| I like to play baseball, but watching it never really thrills me. Are the Yankees in the playoffs this year? ||| that's great! Had you heard about this guy before reading the article? Seems like he was kind of a big deal. ||| do you think it was just a freak accident? Or, was there more to the boat wreck than was indicated? ||| huh, the article made it sound like it was a wreck at high speed or something. The rock story seems less conspicuous. ||| no doubt. well thanks for chatting with me. Go Yankees! bye ||| yeah, lots of ups and downs in that one ||| unfortunately, i think stories like this are all too common with children who go through the foster system. ||| it's really crazy that those two brothers ended up in the same prison ||| astronomical. Do you have any thoughts on how the foster system could be improved? ||| I agree, I also think that counseling services should be provided by the state ||| I think we could all benefit from self sufficiency/life skills classes as teenagers. ||| What kind of skills did you learn? ||| interesting, I don't think my high school offered classes like that. We had home economics, but that was primarily cooking and cleaning. ||| Agreed. What did you think of the sibling that eventually got his masters and now helps kids in similar situations? ||| It's crazy how differently people react to similar circumstances. Thanks for chatting with me today. bye ||| Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed. ||| I agree and am on the same page when it comes to religiosity. It seems like these militant groups in the Middle East are sincerely devoted to unmaking thousands of years of human progress. ||| From what I understand about these groups is that they have decided to pervert their sacred texts in their interpretation so that they are in fact called to violence. An analog would be the Westboro Baptist church here in the states. If someone is not following the same religious tenets as you it makes them much more difficult to control; you aren't playing by the same rules. ||| Hatred can be a very powerful force. Unfortunately, it seems that our world is filled with more of it every day; or at least those who are full of hatred have the loudest voices. I'd like to think that these militants truly believe that they are saving peoples souls, but the fact that they would allow them to stay as long as they paid a tax kind of robs the whole process of any mystique. This whole thing is about power. I agree about any self righteous group too. Can't you find something that is actually productive to do with your time? ||| Exactly, and that conflict prevents them from making any marked social or political progress at the lower levels of society. The rich get richer and the poor are left to fight each other over the scraps that remain. Plus, in a lot of ways America specifically has been spurning on this conflict for it's own vested interest in arms sales. ||| Right, it's a crying shame. I have a very difficult time attempting to put myself in the shoes of the people who are affected by these types of problems. I mean, waking up in the middle of the night to your family being slaughtered or sold into slavery and being told to just deal with it? ||| It's insane. The question is, what can we in the west even do to help? Is there anything at all? ||| I think that it would depend on the approach. I've heard there has been some success in the US forces training a standing army in Afghanistan, but not much. I was thinking more about humanitarian efforts. ||| Yes, and after having this conversation definitely something I need to get more information on. I don't know about you but i've only about ten minutes left on my HIT timer, so why don't we wrap this up relatively quickly? ||| So, do you hail from the states? ||| Ha! Me too. ||| I've just seen them mentioned in mainstream media on occasion. Do you usually keep up with new? ||| I actually heard about that. Totally shameful. Do you have family in the military? ||| My younger brother is currently serving in the army. ||| Back at you! ||| bye ||| yeah, having every place with any a shred of personal significance leveled and re-purposed must be an awful feeling. ||| I'm not sure how I feel about our government being directly involved, but it is nice to not have to worry about being hit with a missile in the middle of the night. ||| It's kind of inspiring how so many people with different religious backgrounds seemed to be living in relative peace before the Islamic State showed up. ||| They seem to think they are on some kind of holy crusade. ||| definitely anachronistic. It seems like they're from some different timeline. ||| How do you feel about them rounding up people to use as human shields? ||| I'm just wondering how exactly they are using them and couldn't that human resource be applied more practically? It just seems like such a waste. ||| oh, i'm not condoning the activity. I'm just wondering why? just, why? ||| hate, most likely hate. ||| well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| I feel like there should be some kind of worldwide contingency plan for situations like this, so the animals won't starve to death in cages. ||| I think i've read about different agencies doing extractions of animals from war torn countries in the middle east, but i'd be willing to be the Venezuelan government would rather have them starve than deal with a foreign presence in their country. ||| against Venezuela? ||| I think that venezuela is being propped up mostly by Cuba/Russia, so we're kind of shooting the messenger in that regard. ||| I think that there is enough going on stateside right now that we should probably shy away from meddling in foreign affairs for the most part, so yes I think we should. ||| Do you think the animals would fair better if they were simply turned loose? ||| I guess it depends on the kinds of animals that are being housed there, but I think giving them a fair shake in the wild is more ethical than starving them to death. ||| I mean, it mentioned that some of the animals hadn't eaten in weeks. I'm sure if they're not feeding them they are also neglecting cleaning and medical care. The poor penguins are probably long gone. ||| oh man, I didn't need that visual ||| I don't want too, but I can. Well, thanks for chatting about this horrific situation with me. bye ||| So, how do you feel about the disappearance of the familiar frozen arctic? ||| I feel similarly, mostly because I feel so helpless. Like, the damage has already been done and we are cursed to watch the tragedy unfold. ||| Them along with 30,000 other species that are on the brink of extinction because of the changing climate and the encroachment of humanity. How do you deal with it? ||| So, your hopeful that there is a practical solution? ||| I don't know, I think that awareness is pretty high even in remote and developing countries. I think that the biggest obstacle at present is outright denial being popularized by psuedo-authoritarian governments. ||| Oh, i'm not advocating for less dissemination of information. The more things like this are highlighted without political bias the more people will be receptive to taking action. ||| I think that we need to take a more active approach in the control of the climate. We need to stop treating it as something supernal because humans can obviously bend it to their own selfish wills. Such as, dumping iron oxide into the ocean to create super massive blooms of plankton. This will not only effectively remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, but sequester it in living things that will thrive off of the nutrition; passing that down the line and enriching our depleted oceans. ||| Go on.. ||| I agree that making more environmental choices in the home will help people adjust for a low energy future, but even at scale those kinds of actions won't do anything to prevent the acceleration of climate change. It's nice for an American to do these paltry things and go to bed at night with a sense of satisfaction, but the events that have been set in motion will have dire consequences for those less fortunate. ||| That's why they're used as a poster child for something much larger. Polar bears are cute and fluffy and easy to feel compassion for from a great distance. Humans being cooked to death and dying from thirst isn't as cuddly. ||| I agree! Thanks for chatting! bye ||| So, how do you feel about the coverage of this so-called accident? ||| Honestly, no. Being struck by an aircraft after ejecting due to a collision? The level of adrenaline must have been unreal. ||| Really? You've never been on an airplane? ||| Right on. I thought the lack of details concerning the cause of the crash was a little suspect. ||| I mean, you can't really say. But, state run media is always a little suspect to me. Plus, the statements supposedly taken from Yu were very sterile and robotic. ||| Yeah, that was very heartening. Also, it didn't mention anything about her family. ||| I also wonder about the logistics of her death. Was she struck by a third plane not involved in the initial collision? Did the pilot and co-pilot of the other plane eject as well? There's just a lot of details that aren't covered in the article. ||| And the government seemed unwilling to answer many of those questions. It was probably just a freak accident, but i'm always suspicious of people's motivations. ||| Her name was Yu Xu. There are lots of articles available online concerning the accident and even videos on YouTube. I think that the story id probably true, but I think the cause of the accident is suspect. Maybe flaws in aviation technology that would make Chinese engineers lose face. ||| I also enjoy watching documentaries. Have you seen any good ones lately? ||| No way, really? That's neat. Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| Have you ever been bullied? ||| Not intensely, that I can remember. There was one older kid on the bus that gave me the business sometimes, but we ended up being friends after a time. How did you respond to being bullied? ||| Haha, no. That was over 15 years ago. Do you have any ideas on the appropriate response to widespread bullying? ||| I understand that, but there are a limited amount of ways to respond to verbal and physical abuse. I don't think that the way children respond varies much from when we were children. I think the key difference is that bullying doesn't end just because you're home from school. It can be something that haunts you around the clock day in and day out. ||| Unplugging, first and foremost. I don't participate in social media, but I think that it has been an overwhelmingly negative influence on society. The reason that children go to the lengths that this French girl did is because they feel absolutely alone in their suffering. Inclusion is the answer. Something as simple as assigning each child a emotional support classmate could do wonders for kids who are being singled out. ||| No, not in any kind of administrative capacity. But, I think that it could potentially be very effective. The modern world has a way of distorting the best of intentions though. ||| Well, an emotional support could potentially become an emotional detriment if a child chose to betray another child's confidence either maliciously or by complete accident. ||| Right, when I was in elementary school we had parent volunteers called \den mothers\"" (our school mascot was a lion) who shared their information with children and provided a sympathetic ear. I'd actually be interested to see what a normal day at a public school looks like these days."" ||| I mean, my youngest brother is now home schooled and I know that people who can afford it now send their children to private schools. The devaluation of public education in the US has been profound and embarrassing. ||| I went to a boarding school for two years in high school. I also absolutely hated it at the time but looking back I was healthier than I had ever been in my life up to that point. I enjoyed chatting with you! bye ||| \bye\"" has to be all lowercase"" ||| Why do you feel that way? ||| Because they left a window open and the toddler pushed through the screen? I know that jumping toward negligence is a common emotional reaction to situations like this, but I think that you're misplacing blame in this instance. ||| In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen. ||| Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered. It's terrible to think of a dead child in any context. ||| I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing. ||| I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity. Tragedies like this are required before any meaningful action is taken across the board. ||| anger is a completely natural response to situations like this I was just picturing the parents sitting in the living room confident in the fact that their children were safe while one lay dead in the parking lot below ||| Yeah, so sympathy was my first response. Do you have children? ||| Well, considering we don't have all the facts I think that's a pretty foolish statement. ||| Your second and third facts are assumptions. The screen could have been secure, but the full weight of a four year old child being pressed against it over an extended period of time could certainly dislodge it. The whole process could have been relatively silent as those details weren't included in the article, hence my statement about having all the facts. It seems your anger is causing you to attempt to establish things as fact that simply can't be substantiated. Thanks for chatting! bye ||| It's a shame that a father-son outing had to end so tragically. ||| Did they actually die on impact, or was the helicopter malfunctioning the reason why they didn't make it out? ||| They must not have fallen very far if they survived the initial impact. Did the article even explain how they ended up falling from the trail? ||| It's really hard to feel overly empathetic in this instance because of the lack of details. ||| I'm not denying the tragedy of the circumstances, but the world at large has become inured to delineations of events like this. ||| Details are what curry empathy among the listener, even something as trivial as mentioning that the child's parents had just divorced or that he had a mother at all would have made the story more relateable. ||| I don't think it's a deviation to suggest how they might have added pathos to the story. ||| That's a tough one. National Parks are large and people take a risk every time they go into the woods. I suppose proactive education is probably the most feasible answer. ||| Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| I've actually experienced this phenomenon second hand and it's just heart breaking. ||| He was only 12. Apparently, he hung himself after being punished by his father for misbehaving. ||| I don't know the details; and i'm not one to make assumptions, but it rang true when the article mentioned that these types of suicide are often impulsive decisions made rashly in emotional circumstances. ||| I think it serves as more than just a resource for methods at this point. Children are exposed to so much on the internet these days it is difficult for me to fathom. ||| Not to mention round the clock exposure to bullies, creeps and the sorry state of the world at large. ||| The world can be painted in very different lights depending on where you are getting your information. The lens through which your world is perceived is much more easily manipulated when you are a child. Do you have any ideas about how to curb online harassment? ||| I suppose it's a possibility, but AI is still its infancy. I think the article had a point when it mentioned that listening to your child and actually having a functional and supportive relationship with them is the greatest deterrent. So many children get home from school and just plug into the television or their telephone. ||| Patience and persistence should be requirements for anyone to become a parent. You can definitely be a refuge for your children without being overbearing. ||| I'm not a parent, so it's quite easy for me to armchair quarterback, but I think a little nuance will go a long way. \How's so and so? Did you see * today?\"" Is your english teacher still a jerk? Etc.\"""" ||| I agree. I think that mental health resources for pre-teens could also have a positive affect on this issue. Well, Thanks for chatting! bye ||| Yep, that was your tenth one! bye ||| Hearing news stories like this makes me feel physically ill. ||| Seeing religion used to excuse actions like this really puts dogma in perspective. ||| I think this is more an example of what happens when there is no social fabric to support people who are easily exploited. ||| Do you think that anything can be done to prevent such things in situations like this? Or, is it just a sorrowful truth about human nature? ||| I think the military is part of the problem in this instance. These are people who have been displaced to refugee camps by violence. ||| Adequate punishment is rarely given in our own armed forces. Frankly, I doubt there will be any justice for the lives that have been forever changed by these events. ||| It's really difficult for me to imagine. Humans are resilient creatures, but the kinds of things that are being allowed to happen at this stage of social progress makes me realize just how lost we are as a species. ||| There are things that can be done, but the likelihood is slim. I think that the United Nations should take up a banner for all refugees. There are people being displaced all over the world and the world is consistently shrugging its shoulders when confronted with that reality. I think they should at least be contributing to relief and temporary placement efforts in affected areas. More people should be volunteering to help. ||| The problem is that humans only have so much empathy to give and this sort of situation seems to roll from one crisis to another with no end in sight. ||| I think that is almost assured. Well, it was nice chatting with you! bye ||| So, how do you feel about this article? ||| I think we're both supposed to share, but I'll start us off. I think that it is shameful that management attempted to blame armed conflict for the sordid conditions. I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place. Noble animals deserve respect and no matter how well maintained a zoo may be they are still imprisoning living creatures. ||| Not only were the animals starved to death, but their bodies were stuffed and mounted under the guise of posterity for a conflict that minimally affected the aggressor in the first place. I'm so glad that there are organizations out there keeping tabs on this kind of cruelty. ||| I think that people involved in the Israel/Palestine conflict could care less about the lives of animals when their own lives (predominately Palestinians) are at risk. You were right when you said that zoos shouldn't be built in the first place, especially in war ridden areas. ||| It's not like going to a zoo like that would be a leisurely activity in the first place. Who would delight in watching as animals starve to death? ||| The good news is that the animals that were rescued were able to be successfully rehabilitated. ||| It's hard to know what a person can do to support more missions like this. Especially since the organization responsible for the logistics is based in Germany I think? I guess the only thing you can do is donate money, but that is such a detached and mirthless way to support a worthy cause. ||| We need three more turns, actually. ||| Definitely, I'd just have to do some research to find out where my money would be best spent. You? ||| Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| How do you feel about these people being displaced by extreme violence and perishing despite the fact that they made it out alive? ||| And the article mentioned that the E.U. was still more focused on preventing these people from reaching their shores than protection and integration. ||| How do you think they rationalize this kind of response to such a crisis? ||| Do you think that immigration and cultural diversity is ultimately a positive or negative influence on an economy? ||| This specific circumstance would be asylum seekers, meaning they are literally fleeing their country to preserve their lives. I think that intake and acclimation centers would come at a hefty cost, but the contributions of asylum seekers would pretty rapidly outweigh any initial expenditure. ||| Especially considering that a lot of these refugees are highly educated and capable of more than just manual labor. ||| Humanity always fairs better with cooperation, it's just sickening to imagine so much potential drowning in the ocean due to fear and indifference. ||| I can understand the E.U.'s position though since the U.S. and Russian Federation have been the major players in both the Lybian and Syrian conflicts. ||| That and it isn't really their responsibility to deal with the fallout. ||| Definitely, well thanks for chatting! bye ||| So, how did you respond to the article? ||| Are you able to empathize with the people who are responsible for the spill and the subsequent clean up? Meaning, can you picture yourself being so concerned with money that you are effectively willing to destroy people's livelihoods? ||| I think there's a sociopathic dehumanization that occurs in people like that. Like, the people potentially affected are seen as so far beneath them that they can't effectively relate to their circumstances. ||| I think you are probably correct. I wish it would have specified what kind of mine it was. We can't keep raping the earth for corporate gain. ||| What would you consider an alternative to these destructive practices? ||| Considering the fact that diamonds can now be convincingly replicated in laboratories, I can't see why the future might not unveil a sort of alchemical equivalent of changing abundant materials into formerly rare materials. ||| The pessimist in me often entertains the thought that we have passed a point of no return when it comes to our environment. I believe that a low energy future will be visited upon humanity by force, not by choice. ||| Change is scary. People are afraid of what they don't understand and that is why human society has had no long lasting fundamental shifts in centuries. Our only hope is that our past won't be forgotten once we get a chance to start over. ||| Do you feel that free market capitalism is a viable ideology moving forward? ||| Hey, I really enjoyed our chat! Have a good one! bye ||| I think it's disgusting that the majority of the casualties in this particular conflict are civilians. ||| How do you feel about the US backing Saudi interests in the region? ||| I agree. Installing a government that doesn't have the support of the local populace is an exercise in futility. ||| Middle East, Central and South America ||| Whom are being funded and armed by the American government. ||| I was just agreeing. What do you think we can do as passive observers to help the people being affected? ||| I agree, but especially in Yemen that aid is being diverted and used by occupying forces and the people are starving. ||| It makes me feel pretty helpless. ||| How about all the people being displaced by conflicts like this? Are you in favor of welcoming refugees to the states? ||| I agree. Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| Where do these governments get the money to pay for damages this extensive? ||| Neither do I. There were only two deaths involved in this article; so while I feel for those affected by both death and destruction of property, it doesn't hit as close to home as some of the other articles I have read. ||| I don't know. It said the quake happened just after midnight, but being in the ring of fire probably prepares people for these kinds of events both in an infrastructural and psychological sense. ||| Have you ever personally experienced an earthquake? ||| Do you happen to know what year the earthquake we read about happened? I don't think it was mentioned. ||| Hm, I wonder if the area has been restored to a functioning capacity. The article talked about dams be broken and billions of dollars of damage being done to roads and buildings. ||| No kidding. Have you ever experienced any natural disaster first hand? Second hand? ||| Was your family/property personally affected? ||| bye ||| In desperate circumstances the basest of man's desires will come to bare. Refugee's are easily exploited and potentially inordinately profitable. I think the reason why a lot of these problems are not being solved is because there are large groups of people who don't want them to be. ||| I worded that improperly. I meant, when people can be easily manipulated and exploited there will undoubtedly be someone willing to do it for personal gain. Like, the so called crisis at our southern border. There are thousands of desperate people being forced into what amount to for-profit prisons funded by tax payer money. Do you think the people running those prisons want to rectify the issue with immigration? Of course not. ||| Do go on. ||| The refugee crisis IS a global problem. Are you suggesting that we just ignore it? ||| Pray explain. The door can always be kicked in. ||| So, you'd prefer ethnic cleansing over immigration reform? Also, you know that most undocumented immigrants don't come through the southern border, right? ||| What do you consider the true disease? ||| You do realize that the US often backs and installs the despotic governments that contravene the public's wishes and interests in these countries to further their own agenda? The resulting turmoil has our governments fingerprints all over it, so that try as they might to elect leaders that work for them they are headed off at every turn by international interest. You're claiming we have no responsibility to these people. I don't believe that. ||| You really think that? ||| I think that your behavior is quite uncivilized. Honestly, It's hard not to think you're a plant from the researcher to elicit a specific type of argument. Keep working on being a good person! bye ||| Yeah, I can't imagine losing my whole family in a flash like that. ||| I mean, besides driver's education and proper posted traffic warnings the only real way is for there to be a larger push for viable mass transportation. ||| Self driving cars will be beyond the means of the average American for another generation at least. The automotive/oil industry still has enough clout to impede progress for years to come. A few human lives can't get in the way of profits. ||| Do you have to commute/drive a car? ||| That's the idea. Do you feel like you're putting your life on the line every time you get out on the road? ||| It's a risk that every motorist takes, and our country was constructed so that in most places an automobile/driver's license/auto insurance are a necessity. I empathize with the victims in the article, but unfortunately it's a reality that we have to deal with as a society. ||| I agree. Normal is a difficult word to parse, but there were 40,100 automobile fatalities in 2017. That's over 100 fatalities per day. ||| I guess I should add a source for credibility: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/business/highway-traffic-safety.html My point is that innumerable lives could be saved with a radical restructuring of transportation in America. ||| Can is one thing, willingness is a totally different monster. I think that high speed rail between metro areas is a viable option that would have manifold benefits. More progressive city planning is also a key investment to a future with less reliance on automobiles and gasoline. The urban sprawl is something we will have to see less and less of. ||| I completely agree. Well, it was nice chatting with you! bye ||| I think divorce can be a healthy or a hurtful thing depending on the people involved. TMZ seemed to take a lighthearted approach to it. What do you think? ||| I'm actually not familiar with these people at all. What are they famous for? ||| Ah, that may explain why I'm not familiar. Are your parents married? ||| My parents split when I was five. I really had a hard time dealing with it during my teenage years. So, I can empathize to a certain extent. I think it would be easier to process as an adult. ||| Divorce is something that unfolds as a child matures. At the time I was aware of the situation, but unfamiliar with the emotions and change that came with your parents splitting up. My father was absent for the lions share of my childhood years, so I spent a lot of time asking why. ||| No worries. Anyway, I think that if two people are unhappy together divorce is the best option for all concerned. ||| Exactly, two happy and constructive homes are a far sight better than one unhappy one. ||| It said they were 22 and 18. So, they are both more or less adults and probably living on their own. ||| I feel the same way ||| bye ||| How do you feel about ISIS's methods of manipulation and control? ||| Well, I think their methods are certainly effective. I don't condone them by any means, but they have disillusioned youth from all over the world joining their rank and file. ||| The thought of children being forced to commit executions is a special kind of venality. ||| This kind of radicalism is rooted in ideologies older than civilization itself. I think the only way to get rid of it would be to allow it to devour itself. ||| I'm inclined to agree. By giving groups like this an enemy we are only feeding the fire of their zealotry. ||| How do you feel about the US's influence in Iraq throughout the past couple of decades? ||| Do you think we should support the people being displaced by the conflict in Iraq? ||| I'm of a similar opinion. There's only so much empathy in a human population. After a certain point the reserves are exhausted and resentment begins to creep in. ||| Does fear play a meaningful part in the decisions you make in your daily life? ||| Well, I'm glad you get some carefree moments. It was nice chatting with you! bye ||| I think that the death of pets is always tragic for those they are dear to. ||| No. I had a dog when I was a teenager. How about yourself? ||| What kind of dogs are they? ||| Neat. I had a golden retriever when I was a kid. He was my best friend. ||| Actually, no. I can't think of anyone even relating a story about a fire to me. How about you? ||| Hopefully they were insured. I mean what do you do after a fire? You just start all over. ||| It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad. ||| Yeah, was it mentioned how the fire started? i don't remember. ||| I believe 2 cats. Wonder if cats can start a fire.. ||| Cats are capable of much more than humans give them credit for ||| bye ||| Yeah, I could have definitely drawn this conclusion without assistance. I think poor air quality affects everyone. ||| Beijing, Santiago, Delhi, L.A. There are so many places where the air really isn't even safe to breath ||| Right? So, it stands to reason that a person suffering from lung cancer would have a lower life expectancy in such a place. Unfortunately, most people can't afford to just move out to the country. ||| Honestly, if there's nothing you can do about it it's probably better for their mental health if they just ignore it. ||| Wouldn't that be a treat? Unfortunately, the EPA has been gutted and the current administration is rolling back protections against air pollution. ||| If the government doesn't do it the environment will. There are already natural controls in place. ||| I think mindfulness is important, but dwelling on destructive things like that turns toxic very quickly. Do you engage in any behaviors that help limit air pollution? I know as individuals we have limited capacities. ||| I agree. I think that's just about all you can do on an individual scale. Good for you! ||| It's nice, but I enjoy seeing everyday people joining the fight just as much. I just recently got my mother into recycling and composting. Her garden has never looked better. ||| Always! Well, thanks for chatting with me. Have a great day! bye ||| How do you feel about baby rhinos? ||| Me too. I wish they would have included more details. The whole thing was very vague. Did the rhino die because of the lack of power? ||| It was really touching how the person spoke about the rhino, almost as if it were their very own child. ||| Yeah, that's part of the reason why the brevity of the article was so frustrating. I'm sure that poaching leaves an inordinate amount of orphaned creatures. ||| Do you have any experience with animals? Pets or otherwise? ||| I came up similarly. My grandparents had a ranch and all the wildlife that comes with it. Do you believe that animals deserve the same rights as humans? ||| I completely agree. Animals are often more loyal and loving than most humans. We need them more than we care to admit as a species and that's not just mammals, birds and insects are an important part of the equation also. ||| My family spoils their dogs rotten. I don't think they could be happier with their position in life, and that makes me glad. I volunteer as a foster pet parent and developing a bond of trust with a troubled pup is one of the most rewarding things. What kind of dogs do you have? ||| Yeah, it's really hard to let them go. I'm reassured by knowing that they are being sent to a happy home where they will be loved and cared for. ||| It really is! Thanks so much for chatting today. It was really pleasant (^_^) bye ||| How do you feel about these, basically, Russian suicide communities? ||| Artificial? How do you mean? ||| It's true, a disturbing amount of humans put more effort into cultivating and maintaining a paltry digital simulacrum of themselves than they do their actual body/mind/relationships. I think in a lot of ways, for children growing up in our world, the digital world is much more real than the one that physically surrounds them everyday. ||| Mindfulness, in essence, is non-committal engagement of ones thoughts and feelings; acknowledging them as they are and letting them pass over you. The internet, on the other hand, is potentially a coliseum of unhinged emotional responses to both real world and subjective events and opinions. I think you're absolutely correct. People in our society are very quick to diagnose themselves, but rarely exert the effort to actually plumb the depths of their personal experience with a person who is qualified to make those diagnoses. ||| I think they are the most capable and most incapable in the same turn depending on the circumstances. I think more actual community involvement is key in these types of situations. Less time online and more time interacting with human beings toward a common goal. ||| If factor in western countries with higher quality of life (Noway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands) whose suicide rates are less then 1% i'm sure it skews the data. ||| It's much easier to make a half hearted effort to apply blame and deal with superficial corollaries of social problems than address them at the root. ||| No, meaningful action against this problem would require time, money, empathy and a sense of duty to ones fellow man that is very scarce in the world today. It's the equivalent of cutting hair and just expecting it not to grow back. ||| Well, help and sympathy are two mutually exclusive concepts. A lot of the time people who are experiencing intense isolation just need someone to talk to. I think that people who are actually diagnosed rely too heavily on prescription medication (which are only supposed to be a temporary crutch) and prefer to ignore the human element in therapy which is often the most beneficial. ||| Ambien, antibiotics, anti-depressants. It's a depressing and short sighted landscape to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting. I think you were probably the most insightful person so far. bye ||| The things you can find on the internet these days. ||| How do you think tragedies like this can be averted? ||| I think an emotional child will always be able to find a place to exacerbate those feelings online no matter how many websites you shut down. ||| I suppose anything is possible. Do you think it could have been prevented had her parents known about her online activity? ||| I think it's important to at least keep a passive eye on your kids online activity. There's so much toxic stuff out there. ||| Truly heartbreaking. All that wasted potential. They seem to be getting younger and younger too. I've seen stories of nine and ten year olds taking their own lives. ||| I really can't even imagine. What do you think drives the people who are hosting the sites and grooming children like this? ||| right? it's not like they get anything else from it besides some satisfaction in having a hand in some child's death. ||| I can only hope that the Russian government has been successful in cracking down on sites like this. ||| bye ||| Certainly not me. ||| Pet trade? I thought the article was more about the transfer of material from human constructs to natural ones? ||| I guess the pet trade could potentially be involved. Do you know anyone with pet frogs? ||| I've always been a bit persnickety about the caging of animals. ||| Honestly, this article lacked some of the emotional appeal that others I have read have had. I mean, I feel for the frogs, but it didn't really offer any solutions to the problem. ||| I felt the human involvement part was minimized by the fact that they mentioned people definitely shouldn't stop building garden ponds. I mean, it's hard to believe people are consciously moving amphibians from garden ponds to natural ones, but what do I know. ||| You have a point. I wonder if the problem is isolated in the UK or if it is a problem elsewhere too. ||| Do you think there are any practical solutions that weren't mentioned in the article? ||| Hm, perhaps if they manufactured a cure for the virus that could be spread in the same way as the virus itself, but that would probably take more time and resources than people were willing to commit. ||| Well, thanks for chatting! have a good one! goodbye ||| Have you had any first hand experience with alzheimers or dementia? ||| My great grandfather. It's really sad to think that the police had to reach out to the community to find out where this person belonged. She must have lived alone.. or in a poorly tended elderly community. ||| We all eventually become children a second time, it's true. ||| That's the most unnerving part about it, how much it hurts your family to see you in such a place. ||| That's what my grandfather did with his parents. I honestly don't think I could handle having to carry my mother to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Good on you. ||| Yeah, as difficult as it sounds, the thought of her sitting alone and confused in some nursing home would be even more psychologically damaging. ||| Well, and so people don't get along so swimmingly with their familial relations. ||| Indeed, my uncle died unexpectedly a few years ago and now my grandparents insist that the family gets together at least once a week. ||| One of my brothers and I live in different parts of the country, but the rest of the family participates. My grandmother sends me text messages every day. It's nice. ||| My condolences for your losses. I hope you treasured your time with all of them. I'm sure they treasured their time with you. Thanks for chatting with me today. goodbye ||| Smugglers and refugees, yes. You? ||| I think that even though the article was from 2016 it is still very relevant. I also thought it quite morbid that no accounts of rescue were mentioned. These people are drowning along well trafficked routes through the Mediterranean and no one can be bothered to help? At all? ||| I wonder how many of the one million refugees Merkel promised to harbor actually made it to Germany. ||| Yeah, it was a little discursive. One minute were talking about smugglers, then were on to drownings and finally some war reporting. It would have scanned better emotionally with better focus. ||| Also, smugglers barely got a mention in passing. What kind of smugglers were they? Where are they from? That was a lead to nowhere. ||| Now am wondering which journalist, and more importantly, which journal of opinion, would run such a slap dash article. ||| Wow, you really paid your dues in attention. I don't watch/read much CNN. You have any ideas on how to deal with integration of all these refugees into western society? ||| I wonder about the UN's effectiveness sometimes. I'd like to see some numbers on how these people are being settled. ||| Not just international help, but international agreement on the correct course of action, the place has to be a hornets nest. ||| Right, it's not like anyone wants to leave their home. They are forced from the houses of their father's and then drown in the ocean alone and afraid. Jeez.. thanks for chatting, bye ||| I think she lived a full life. ||| I had, but I was a very small child during the Clinton admin, so I didn't really know her function or capacity as a politician. ||| Oh yeah! I had completely forgotten about that kid. I wonder what he is up to now. ||| Do you have any experiences with Parkinson's disease? ||| Nope, not personally. I really don't know that much about it. ||| Is that part of it? Doesn't it make your hands shake also? ||| Do you think there will be another female attorney general in the near future? ||| I think its likely. I don't know who it might be though. ||| I follow them with mild interest. It gets to be very depressing after a while though. Do you vote? ||| Yeah, next year is going to be a circus. Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| So, how do you feel about the Paris attacks? ||| I agree, I can't imagine being roused from bed with news that a family member had been the victim of a terrorist attack. The racist backlash is just the simplest knee jerk reaction to this kind of thing when there is no other revenge to be had. ||| Yeah, of all the details that was the most barbed. ||| I think it depends on the type of person he is. Something tells me this is the kind of thing that will always haunt you. ||| I was speaking more about the loss of a child than focusing hatred on the shooters, but thankfully I don't have any firsthand experience either. ||| Right. I'm curious as to what the demographics were of the rest of the crowd. ||| Fortunately, attacks of this scale don't happen very often. I think that there will be even more of a threat now with so many people emigrating from the middle east to new homes in Europe. ||| I see racism and nationalism as the threat. The quickest way for someone to find themselves in this terrorist groups is to be alienated and discriminated against. ||| People love to have a simple solution to the complex problems that they have to deal with every day. Blaming immigrants is the easiest way to explain away all of their problems at once all while creating a common enemy. ||| Yep, the same tactics have been used for millennia and continue to be effective. ||| I think it is a very thoughtful was to memorialize anyone. I hope that he can one day find peace through constructive activities like that. Thanks for chatting today! bye ||| And for what? The aggressors must know that this is a fight they can't win. ||| It's just basic dehumanization. It's used the world over to create a common enemy that doesn't deserve to share the air that you breathe. Since these people don't believe the same twisted dogma I do, I am doing them a favor by killing/persecuting them. I'm sure many of these murderers sleep quite well at night. ||| It's almost anachronistic in this day and age, but these countries just haven't progressed socially or technologically at the same rate as the west due to oppressive religiosity. It's like a snapshot from 200 years ago. ||| Primitive, but effective. ||| Fear and intimidation are effective no matter where you are on the planet. ||| Control. You think the warlords at the top of the ladder aren't living like kings? That's how young men are coerced into joining unwinnable fights like this. It may be myopic, but in the short term someone is making a lot of money. ||| I guess it's about perspective. ||| And a far right radical Muslim sees the death of each and every blasphemer as a victory in the eyes of his God. They perceive their task as divine. I'm not condoning their behavior, I'm saying that perception is relative. ||| bye ||| Hi, the more I read these articles the more helpless I feel. ||| And what can you do about it? Donate to an NGO and then hear more and more about how the situation continues to worsen and  countries have accepted all the refugees they can manage. ||| The answer is playing out in front of us. These people will be permanently displaced, sold into slavery and forced into military service. ||| Most empathetic people do, but it is beyond the collective will of empathetic people to influence anything on such a grand scale. ||| I think the willingness of places like France and Germany to take in tens of thousands of refugees is a step in the right direction, but this kindness needs to be accompanied by infrastructure that can successfully integrate these people into European society. ||| Exactly, foreigners that are brought in and promptly alienated/become the victims of prejudice and hatred will only curry the nationalist attitudes we are seeing today. ||| Huh, i'm not finding any information from reliable sources about mass rapes? Could you send me a trustworthy link? ||| Goodness, well do you have any ideas to that affect? Helping people to get along? ||| I agree, greed creates poverty and poverty is the biggest problem we have right now. ||| back at you! goodbye ||| Not as long as Russia is propping up Assad's regime. ||| No, I really can't. It's hard to believe so many people are surviving in what is essentially a war zone. ||| The thing is, I don't think they necessarily WANT to leave. It's a choice between fleeing and dying. ||| It's Syria's problem, no the US's. Getting involved would only make things more complicated than they already are. ||| It's not that we always have to, it's that our country has global ambitions that can be furthered by taking sides in foreign conflict. The wealthy people in this country can't afford to leave well enough alone. ||| I think it's the moral thing to do, but there should be infrastructure in place to acclimate refugees into western society after they have been granted asylum, quotas should be more realistic based on the resources available for this infrastructure and volunteers are absolutely necessary to help move the process along in a supportive capacity. ||| I think that is the only way that the problem will be addressed cooperatively. If every country is dealing with the same dilemma, people will be more likely to collaborate on a solution. ||| That's because there are no structures in place to acclimate the refugees as I had mentioned before. In the Middle East, rape is non-existent. You're putting people from an anachronistic ideological system who don't speak the language out into a culture that they are incapable of understanding. A transitional period is absolutely necessary for relocation on this scale to work. ||| Especially after the situation has already been so embarrassingly mishandled. The distrust and prejudice against immigrants has already taken root. ||| The entire world is in a sorry place regarding trust these day. Thanks for chatting! goodbye ||| What a disturbing message to receive. ||| leave everything you've ever known and strike out on the road I guess? It amazes me that there are even still people living in Aleppo after eight years of this. ||| Wow, have you ever talked to the about their feelings/desired resolution to the conflict? ||| It must be heartbreaking. One of my best friends is from Iran and he can't go home because he'd be immediately conscripted for military service. ||| military service is compulsory for all men of a certain age, so if he went back he would be forced into military service until he had fulfilled the required period of time. I think it's something like three years. ||| lot's of places have similar obligations for native citizens, like Norway and South Korea for example. Things are just a lot more dicey in the middle east. ||| Yep, ive heard stories of Norwegians expatriating of even committing suicide to not have to serve in the military. ||| it's a relatively wide spread practice that definitely messes with people who are pacifists. That's what's so sad about the situation in Syria. A lot of the people are civilians who are just caught in the crossfire of larger nation's political agendas. ||| How much longer do you think the fighting will drag on now that the U.S. is pulling out and allowing Turkey to advance? ||| Me either, unfortunately. Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| How do you feel about the president's outspoken disdain for specific demographics? ||| I think it's effective for galvanizing his base, most of whom don't pay attention to politics in any meaningful way. It's a dirty way to  play, but i'd expect nothing less from him. ||| Therein lies the difference. He has made outspoken racists/nationalists/fascists comfortable enough to go out and steal/murder/rape and know that others like them will celebrate their actions. ||| Yeah, and I work in juvenile justice. These mass shooters often make a comfortable living, get married and are celebrated in prison. It's literally a career path for hateful alienated people and it's disgusting. ||| I think the reality that most people are *extremely online* plays a big role in this kind of thing manifesting itself. Online communities are predominately just people patting each other on the back for their behaviors and beliefs. ||| They probably could if they tried to find an actual group of people and not just a collection of avatars online. ||| Pardon? ||| Why would they? Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is as prevalent as ever and no action is being taken to keep dangerous people from acquiring firearms. Do you? ||| It's definitely a possibility. With the coming recession tensions are only going to run higher. ||| I think it is a distinct possibility. The whole thing is going to be hard to watch regardless of the outcome. ||| Back at you. bye ||| This was one of the saddest stories I have read so far. ||| Just picturing these poor little kids being so hungry they literally can't even stay awake. Goodness. I wonder how widespread the problem really is. ||| I actually read that article too. I'm sure that the government is using plenty of resources to make sure only a fraction of what is going on down there is actually reported on. ||| Yeah, maduro is clinging to power because of being propped up by Cuban and Russian interests. ||| I know that there's hyper-inflation and therefore a growing preference for crypto-currencies and that the military is making quite a bit of money by transporting cheaply bought Venezuelan gasoline to neighboring countries and selling it at an incredible profit. Then, you have the people fleeing the country only to end up in more compromising positions, but beyond that I'm pretty uninformed as well. ||| well, and according to the article they have the iconic \bread lines\"" where people have to line up at a specific time just to have a chance at purchasing bare necessities."" ||| Yeah, I get annoyed by not having some ingredient that is essential to a recipe and having to run to the store, but at least there's a store to go to and food to be had. It's wild how jaded you become living such a priviliged life. ||| The vast majority of Americans probably don't even know what intense hunger feels like, but it's a daily reality for these poor kids. ||| and the article mentioned that with such poor nutrition the children can't even retain any of the information their supposed to be learning. ||| no kidding. well, thanks for chatting with me today! bye ||| This incident actually happened relatively close to me. ||| If i remember correctly, he was an Iraq veteran who suffered from ptsd and his wife was leaving him. ||| unfortunately, that's a common thread for military and police alike. He didn't know how to respond to what was unfolding around him and his family paid the ultimate price. ||| Projection and internalization most likely. His projected his worldview onto his children and thought they would be better off dead than living through his personal hell. I'm not expressing sympathy. I rarely have any for those who harm women and children, just stating the facts that i'm familiar with. ||| but, I do have immense sympathy for his wife. She was trying to do the right thing by her children and they still ended up getting killed. ||| No, I really can't. It takes so much courage to leave an abusive relationship. Then, to have it all come tumbling down around you would make it very easy to blame yourself. ||| I'm not sure, but I have done quite a few of these empathy exercises over the past month or so. What makes you say that? ||| I think it's something that would take an immense amount of time and effort to mourn properly and then confront the emotions you are feeling with an open mind and a supportive network of friends/family. The process would be absolutely daunting at the outset, but people are pretty tenacious. ||| Yeah, I lost a dear childhood friend seven years ago and i'm still processing the loss. It's really something to lose someone. I certainly wish her the best. ||| Thanks, it most certainly is. Well, thanks for chatting with me (again). Hope you have a great day! bye ||| I can, unfortunately. ||| Civilians? No. The military contractors, oil barons and politicians were counting on it. ||| Yep, human lives are nothing weighed against big piles of money. ||| I only have one living relative who served. The vehicle he was in ran over an IED and he was the only one who survived. He now requires static pulses directly applied to his spinal column to feel/use his lower body. ||| The thing is, he's not bitter about it at all. The article hardly mentions the Afghan civilians who were murdered, who didn't sign up for this kind of horror ||| That resentment will live on for generations. Foreign powers make their home unlivable and then refuse them when they try to leave. ||| We can't move away from the stuff quick enough. ||| Wealthy people will always find a reason to sacrifice the poor. In 100 years it will be for water, etc, etc ||| Much further than they will go to be happy ||| We're a cursed breed, to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting! You were a delight. bye ||| I wasn't aware that there were people employed to exterminate wildlife here in the contiguous U.S. ||| I wonder who they are employed by. Anyway, I feel sorry for the poor wolf. ||| I highly doubt anyone will suffer any consequences, but I would assume a verbal reprimand at most. ||| The hyperbole used in the article really doesn't help to curry much sympathy, you're right. ||| I know that oil and gas companies will hire exterminators in the far north to keep wild animals away from workers in the wild. I highly doubt it was close to civilization. ||| Could be, they could have just been having some fun. The fact is it's hard to be empathetic when thousands of innocent domestic animals are thrown into furnaces every day. ||| Like so many other articles churned out by the modern news media. I think a significant minority are written by AI these days. ||| Really? I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube. Are they entertaining? ||| Ah, are there any circumstances similar to the one in the article that would excite you emotionally? Endangered animal? Drunken assailant? ||| I know the feeling. Thanks for chatting. bye ||| The world is a vampire. ||| I mean that from the day you are born until the day that you die the amount of options you have to dictate your own fate shrink substantially. ||| We're talking about vastly different periods of time, but you are certainly entitled to your opinion. ||| Life in modern society is characterized by indoctrination. You are honed as far as your opportunity and ambition to fill a specific role in society will allow and then you are bound to that by the costs of subsistence. There are always exceptions, but this is the reality for most human beings. The man in the article is probably somewhat inured to slings and arrows, but that doesn't make it right to persecute him because of others mistakes. ||| I didn't say we weren't free to choose, I said that as we choose our freedom to navigate outside those choices becomes more limited the more choices you make. You're trying to make this political and missing the point entirely. Do you feel any empathy toward the man in the article? ||| It's probably difficult for you consider abstract concepts. I apologize. Do you think that he would have been better off if deported at 18 instead of 41? ||| Do you believe his children should be deported as well? ||| Why not? ||| Did you make any assumptions as to what he had been in trouble with the law for? ||| gotta be lower case, friend bye ||| Do you have much empathy for Jeffery or the victim? ||| Are there circumstances that wouldn't warrant your empathy? ||| I consider myself similarly, that's why I was curious. I feel like a lot of information was missing from this story. Most people don't brutally murder, immolate and bury a person because of a refused sexual advance. ||| It seemed like a pretty high profile case. There wasn't much mentioned about the victim, but I just read that Jeffery got the maximum sentence of 28 years at the end of last year. ||| Right, how do you pick up the pieces after spending the prime of your life in prison? ||| I wonder if his surrogate father will maintain a relationship with him after all that has happened. ||| I can't imagine. He literally gave him an opportunity to live in peace and security and he threw it back at him in such a violent fashion. ||| I'm sure there were probably traumatic events, as in any childhood, but being thrust into a life a luxury/copious amounts of alcohol and drugs (based on the article I read) can cause anyone to act erratically. ||| And, when you're that far under the influence your reactions to drastic stimulus will be warped. They probably knocked him from the fourth story window on accident, realized that he was badly injured, reasoned that they would have to kill him and cover it up, etc. etc. ||| It's a shame... Thanks for chatting! goodbye ||| I agree, but we keep people in cages all day. Our society is built on the persecution out groups of all species. ||| That's debatable. There are people the world over her are imprisoned for being raised to believe in a particular religion, or for holding a particular ideology. I'm just attempting to point out that the world at large has little mind for the suffering of those they are not directly involved with. Do you think the elephant could be successfully reintegrated into a more natural habitat after so many years of abuse and neglect? ||| I suppose anything is better than continued indentured servitude and imprisonment, right? ||| These safaris are simulated savanna? Here in the U.S.? ||| No, I went to Disney Land years ago. Do they feature a lot of animals? Do they actually incorporate significant numbers of rescues? ||| Yeah, I was thinking more about a sanctuary than a amusement park attraction. That's neat. Do you keep pets? ||| Do you have a stance with regard to animal rights? If so, what kind of rights should they be afforded? ||| Well, i think that it's a complex issue when we are considering food supply. Factory farming is an ethical wasteland, and very little is going to be done to improve the circumstances for those poor creatures without significant external pressure. I firmly believe they shouldn't be imprisoned for amusement. ||| Industrial livestock production that focuses on maximizing output through use of hormones/pen that restrict full range of motion and minimizing bottom line production costs. ||| Yep, that's where most affordable meat in the grocery store comes from and in places like texas it is actually illegal to defame beef in any way. Thanks for chatting! bye ||| What'd you think of the article? ||| My emotions could also be considered \mixed.\"""" ||| As a smoker myself, I felt the need to parley with the author of the article. ||| Frankly, I enjoy the fact that the space is dwindling. Smoking is more than a nicotine fix for me. It also gives me an excuse and an opportunity to get away from other people for a while. The only time it really bothers me is when I've got a flight with connections. ||| The government dictates a lot of what people can and can't do in public. I'm assuming you don't smoke. Are you bothered by seeing/smelling people smoke in public? ||| It may not be an apt analogy, but I equate smoking in public to open carry. I'm not comfortable with seeing a person holding a gun on their hip, it makes me nervous for my health and the health of those around me. But, people are allowed to do it and I just keep my distance. ||| Planes, schools, hospitals... I'm trying to think of another behavior that has been similarly restricted but i'm coming up short. ||| My grandfather had a '57 Chevy that didn't have seatbelts. You can still have open containers in Missouri. Our childhood hasn't disappeared yet. ||| That's actually an idea everyone could profit from. Imagine having to look service workers in the face and appreciate their contribution to society at large. ||| Eh, more people profit from cell phone use than smoking. It's been a joy chatting with you. Have a good one! bye ||| Have you ever imagined killing another person? ||| I've pictured myself in situations where that might be an eventuality. You've never hypothetically lived as a soldier? You've never imagined having to take a family member off life support? ||| We frame things in a certain way to make them easier to live with. Do you think that living in a world ridden with bad news has compromised our ability to sympathize with victims of murder? ||| While reading the article I tried to think of what kind of impetus it would take for me to end another human beings life. I couldn't find one. Is there some kind of stimulus that would drive you to take such drastic action? ||| That's totally reasonable. Did it strike you as odd that this happened in an airport? ||| Yeah, these articles are everything but thorough. ||| Having dealt with delays for much less morbid reasons, yes I believe I would. How about you? ||| That's the ticket isn't it? How many people cared about the victim? How will it affect their lives having to deal with the grief of losing a loved one. That's the kind of news that doesn't get reported on. ||| Right. It's the body count that people tune in for. The reality of living with it is a one off and much more difficult to report on. ||| Wow. I can understand why something like that would stick. Wish you the best. Thanks for chatting! bye ||| I feel like the article said more about Suu Kyi than what actually precipitated the violence. ||| I can understand why the Rohingya are upset though. Despite being born in living their lives in Burma they are being denied any types of citizenship rights and are constantly the victims of violence. ||| Seems like there is an increasing number of Muslim minorities being used as scapegoats and being forcefully relocated these days. I read that the Rohingya that fled to Bangladesh are no being forced back into Burma. The situation with the forced reeducation of Uyghers in China. Seems like there's a lot going on. ||| Unfortunately, Donald Trump and articles about climate change get more clicks than anything else here in the states. People (myself included) find it really hard to put themselves into these oppressed people's shoes because the idea of living in a makeshift hovel and being persecuted for your religion is such a foreign concept. ||| It's so easy to take things for granted when you are comfortable. ||| I'm inclined to believe that they don't have access to plastic straws or classmates. The Bangladeshi government even removed internet access from the border areas where they are eking out an existence. ||| Do you think there is a practical solution to the problems they are facing within Burma? ||| Considering the fact that making risotto can be a complex situation, I'm inclined to agree. Do you think the current solution is to just have them die in abject poverty? They've been \working\"" on this for years now."" ||| I agree. Knowing what little I do about the situation it seems that they are being blamed for circumstances they have very little control over in order to incite violence against them. ||| Yeah, we definitely would have profited from more thorough source material. Thanks for chatting! Have a good one. bye ||| I can't imagine what it must be like to live in a war torn country, especially one where the ROE seem not to apply. ||| How do you feel about the U.S. seemingly downplaying their role in war crimes? ||| Right? I think our love affair with Saudi Arabia's petro dollars has been nothing but trouble since the start. ||| Yeah, when you start targeting hospital and starving people it's time to take a step back. ||| I have heard a lot about refugees from Syria, I wonder where people are fleeing to from Yemen? ||| Yeah, not to mention that terrorist have been hitting international aid envoys, so I'm sure a lot of people are too hungry to flee. The whole thing is just heartbreaking. ||| It's so shameful. We're setting such a terrible example of what to do when one wields great power. We seem to have embraced the power while shirking the responsibility that comes with it. ||| The least they could do is report on more international news without resorting to making it partisan. ||| I agree. Stuff like that just doesn't get clicks like stories about what Trump tweeted today or global warming get. ||| I wish I didn't feel so helpless about the situation. Well, thanks for chatting. bye ||| Well, this was a particularly awful article to read. ||| The girl or the parents, frankly. ||| I'm wondering how much hypothetical money it took for these people to behave this way. ||| Yeah, there's a lot of lurid details that inspire curiosity but i'd be comfortable never knowing. Do you think her mother was coerced by her father or do you think the money inspired her to willingly participate? ||| Especially the lengths she went to to normalize and encourage the behavior. Honestly, my stomach is churning just thinking about some of the details included in the article. Do you think going on network television with her issue has been a positive or negative experience for the victim? ||| Yeah, actually i'm more inclined to believe that a person would claim something like this happened to them on TV for money than what is actually being described. ||| Do you have an opinion on Dr. Phil? ||| I think that's an apt evaluation. What do you think would help people in situations like these the most? ||| I agree. Well, thanks for chatting ||| bye ||| That was such a sad article regarding China miners ||| I live in Colorado but grew up in Kentucky.   So many miners died in Eastern Kentucky.  In comparison, there seems that China was incredibly terrible at giving the miners a safe work space. ||| Yes they did.  I just always wondered how painful these accidents to those who just suffocate in the mine waiting on people to get to them. ||| Let's hope so.   As you already stated, the families waiting on the miners to be retrieved must be an experience that most never encounter. ||| All deaths are sad; however, this seems to be more challenging.  It would be an image I would never forget. ||| I have.   I lost my dad at the age of 40.   He left 3 girls - 17, 15, 12.   My mom died at 76 of alzheimer's.   What about you? ||| Your friend was so very young.  I'm sorry.   Enjoy your family every day because you just never know when that day comes. ||| It did.  It was coal.  China is the biggest producer of coal as well as consuming it. ||| I don't.   I got to go in one deep coal mine because I made loans to those miners.   The only thing I saw were huge fans and they were vented out of the earth.  I do not know if that is the same thing though. ||| Just guessing I would think 18-65.   The State of Administration of Work Safety ordered an investigate of what happened.   I don't understand why they were not inspected more closely. ||| Goodbye ||| You would think that the well on your property would be one of the first places that you looked. ||| It obviously wasn't since they had 500 people searching for the boy before they started digging, but ok. How would you feel in the child's shoes? The families? ||| Yeah, they were a little sparse with the details. Was he killed on impact? Technically, they could have easily lowered food and water to him to keep him alive until he was unearthed. Perhaps he drowned? ||| It reminds me of that Simpson's episode.. Radio Bart I think it was, but with a much more tragic ending. Are your children similar in age to the child in the story? ||| Ah, well what are your biggest fears for the children in your family? I'm going to assume it isn't falling down wells. ||| I can't imagine. Yeah, when I was a kid we always stayed out until dusk just roaming around the neighborhood. I guess that isn't really a thing anymore. ||| Do you think that the risk in modern America of such terrible things happening has actually increased, our anxiety has been exacerbated by the inundation of horrifying news stories or it's a combination of both? ||| Have you ever been a part of a search party? ||| No, but once when I was visiting my great grandfather in Oklahoma my family got involved in a search for a young kid who had gone missing from his home. They found him but unfortunately he was hanging from a tree in a field. Apparently, he had had a fight with his father. ||| No kidding, that's horrible. Well, thanks for chatting with me today! Hope you have a nice afternoon. bye ||| How do you feel about gender equality in the U.S.? ||| I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato. ||| Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers. ||| Also, it's partly being locked into the \just world\"" fallacy. Lots of people believe that people are paid more simply because they work harder or are more effective."" ||| No, she worked for the state and was offered \promotions\"" but her pay grade was the same and the workload was heavier. She now works for a non-profit and is the music leader at her church which she gets paid for. She seems much happier."" ||| Thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're supposed to be a bastion of freedom and equality but most of western Europe and some of the more progressive Asian nations have been outpacing us with regard to gender equality for some time. ||| It's true, our public education system has become a national embarrassment in most places. I haven't been inside one in years and frankly i'm afraid of what they look like on the inside these days. ||| They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a \gifted\"" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools."" ||| It was an enriching experience to be sure, but having everything come so easily early on made learning healthy study skills and habits a trial to learn once I started college. I was glad to read that the U.S. is improving with regard to educational equality.. ||| Just that news like this will inspire people to speak up and act on their own pride and in their own best interest. Thanks so much for chatting today! bye ||| I guess I think that restructuring society in a more egalitarian fashion is going to take a lot longer than it should. ||| I equate it to self help for an entire species. People just can't be bothered to do anything about it until it gets out of hand. ||| That's a very good point actually. Most men are content to sit on their hands on this particular issue. ||| I honestly don't think it would result in lower pay. That's one of the scare tactics used by anti-feminists to scare men into their belief system. The same is used as a foil for affirmative action and other progressive initiatives. ||| It's just that diversity in the workforce actually creates more opportunities in the long run for all concerned instead of filling up a limited number of spaces. What do you think should be done to stimulate the closing of the gender gap? ||| Simple enough. Do you think it is in the hands of businesses and corporations to spearhead the change, or does the responsibility lie with the public, or both? ||| I think they definitely have the greatest capacity to incite social change, but also the biggest incentive to maintain the status quo. ||| Like a carbon tax, but for gender inequality. ||| Do you think it's a realistic goal? Or, do you think it's overly idealistic to attempt to overthrow centuries of social norms and inequality? ||| I agree. Thanks for chatting with me today! bye ||| How much longer do you think the ocean can keep taking one for the team? ||| Not to mention Japan dumping the nuclear waste from Fukushima into the Pacific recently. ||| Do you think there are practical steps that governments could take against this (and other) types of oil incidents? ||| I think it should absolutely be required that fail safes be in place before they begin drilling. I mean, it's not like these oil drilling outfits are strapped for cash or anything. ||| We can't move away from oil and gas soon enough. We're going to continue drawing it up until it's completely gone, but it would be nice to get to a place where we don't need it anymore to function. ||| I feel like the wheels are already in motion. I'm not trying to unfairly minimize the nobility of working toward a low energy future; because eventually people will have to, but the engine has too much inertia to be stopped now. ||| Our children's future will be marked by mass climate migrations, scarcity of water and legendary wildfires unfortunately, regardless of how we behave today. ||| And developers keep building in places that will literally be under water in a decade! ||| Ridiculous. Well, thanks for chatting today. bye ||| I think we've been seeing articles like this for far too long. ||| Seems like the civilians always outnumber the soldiers too. ||| I mean, the soldiers know what they signed up for. They pay the ultimate price in service of their country/ideology, but we're blowing apart entire families on a regular basis for a reason most Americans don't even remember anymore. ||| They have just started dropping bombs indiscriminately, very few strikes are based on reliable intel. I read a story yesterday that schools and hospitals are being hit. I believe that constitutes a war crime. ||| Do you believe that this kind of foreign policy encourages terrorism? ||| Drone strikes and killing civilians. ||| I agree. I can't imagine coming home in the evening and finding my entire family killed. That kind of anger must be all consuming. ||| I think it's to prevent the expansion of ISIS and Al-Qaeda after the Iraq war, but even i'm not positive. ||| Unfortunately, Trump and climate change have dominated the news cycle for the past three years. Most Americans know very little about what is going on abroad. ||| It's a race to the bottom. Well, thanks for chatting with me! bye ||| I wasn't aware that only three species of mammal can carry leprosy. ||| No kidding! Also, most representations of the disease in the media are flagrantly misleading. ||| You certainly don't see a lot of credible documentaries on most media outlets. Do you live in an area with populations of armadillos? ||| Actually, yes. They have been moving northward due to changing temperatures in the south and it's not uncommon to see them on roadways. They're cute but now i'm inclined to keep my distance. ||| They carry leprosy that can be transferred to humans according to the article. ||| Yeah, it's a shame that the species of squirrel that has been found to carry the disease is also endangered. ||| Right? All this time and we still haven't found a cure. Apparently, it also goes by the name of Hansen's disease. Did you know there are leper colonies in Hawaii? ||| Yep, and apparently one of the biggest risk factors for contracting leprosy is living in poverty. There's still plenty of that to go around. ||| Have you ever had first hand experience with a serious illness? ||| I've dealt with food poisoning on a couple of different occasions, but nothing I would label as \serious.\"" Thanks for chatting and being so responsive. bye"" ||| The situation in Syria is really a gut check, even from the perspective of a helpless bystander. ||| It blows my mind that there are any people still trying to eke out an existence there after this has been going on for almost a decade. ||| It's hard to progress when the governing body has dug in its heels and is content to murder its own citizenz. ||| I think the mindset that they have is that the citizens are simply a resource to be exploited, like lumber or minerals. ||| It's actually not uncommon, the results in more advanced society just have lower fatality rates. Think about how replaceable the average American worker is. ||| Not generally, but lack of affordable healthcare is responsible for a lot of premature deaths especially among the unemployed and underemployed. ||| But no shortage of laws and deterrents to keep people from forming unions that would demand equitable treatment for workers. ||| In these uncertain times businesses have to focus on turning the largest profit in the shortest amount of time, I guess/ ||| Always, but what can you do? ||| It's absolutely impossible. Well, thanks for chatting today. bye ||| This particular article was really trying to pull on the heartstrings. ||| Yeah, the amount of detail and effort put into trying to encourage the reader to vicariously live out the last moments of its life was a little off putting. ||| That tactic is used by a lot of animal rights groups and frankly, it has the opposite effect on me personally. I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat. ||| Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof. ||| I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning. ||| Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about! ||| Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle. ||| Supremely doubtful, it's not like they have the help of law enforcement or anything. They are basically going vigilante in the hopes of solving a case with no evidence or power to investigate. ||| That's the long and short of it right? Wouldn't the time be better spent fostering living pets or something similar? ||| There are certainly more personal and pressing things to lose sleep over. Well, thanks for chatting today. Have a good one! bye ||| Did you have a particularly strong emotional reaction to this article? ||| How so? ||| Which war in particular? I read this as an isolated incident concerning an ally and miscommunication. ||| The Syrian civil war has been going on for eight years and America has been at least tacitly involved since the get go. Anyway, I think that this was just Jordanian soldiers being a little jumpy because of the recent terrorist attack and American soldiers not following protocol. ||| It's a war of attrition that has many foreign interests in play. The fact that it boils down to having a secular government or a Muslim government makes it even more volatile. Since there have been hundreds of thousands of refugees and more than half of the internal population displaced, I think the question is: What will be left to claim if it ever does end? ||| It's just the new imperialism. Instead of actively occupying a region with strategic value, just install a government that will play ball and silently control policy within the country from abroad. ||| Quite. But, the fact is these countries couldn't properly function without aid from more developed nations. Governments use that as leverage and the populaces interests fall by the wayside. ||| I really don't know very much at all, but I do try to keep up with international politics. It's something I never could have pictured myself doing even five years ago because it can be very depressing, but here we are. Plus, I like history and learning about other cultures. ||| It's also very telling about the core concepts of human nature. It's a shame that we've essentially been solving disputes the same way since the beginning of recorded history. ||| Yep, well thanks for chatting today. Hope you have a pleasant afternoon! bye ||| bye ||| I seem to hear more stories about train crashes than I do about plane crashes. It seems strange to me. ||| No, but I think a train crash would have a higher survival rate depending on the circumstances. ||| Do you have much empathy for the victims of the crash? I mean, as much as one person can for a tragedy at a distance? ||| I do, but it wasn't a particularly emotional article. I mean, I'm not going to lost any sleep over it or anything. Have you ever lost a loved one in an accident? ||| I'm sorry to hear that. We're they DOA or did they receive treatment at a hospital? ||| My goodness. What a tragedy. My condolences. ||| Not only that, but when one is totally helpless to affect a more positive outcome the empathy can often seem misplaced or disingenuous. ||| People, especially people in developed nations often take it for granted because they don't realize how quickly it can be taken away. ||| Back at you, but I think we're only up to nine. bye ||| I think that a full belly is taken for granted in our country. You? ||| Only if it starts to mold and cutting off the moldy section wouldn't save it. How about you? ||| Where do you buy your produce? ||| Do you shop at regular intervals or do you just go when you need things? ||| I go once a week and try to only buy things to last me for that week. I actually end up throwing out fresh spices like cilantro/thyme/etc because I haven't found a way to properly store it. ||| I'll go out to eat once a week or so, but I love cooking. ||| How do you feel about food waste coming from grocery stores, restaurants and the like? Is there a practical way to cut down on the immense amount that they contribute? ||| That's a good one. I'm sure some places have programs like that in place. ||| Would you purchase irregular food if given the opportunity to prevent such waste? Misshapen, discolored or otherwise? ||| Definitely! Well, thanks for chatting! bye ||| Well, this article was a little vague and confusing. ||| Why do you feel bad for the police? ||| No, the article I read only mentioned one 70 year old man and the shooter being dead. Then, it looped back around and said the shooter was still barricaded in his house at the end. ||| I think that police are trained to be aggressive in both speech and action, but only listening/watching media outlets will give you a very biased view of the situation. You? ||| On several occasions, but that hasn't negatively colored my perception of a group of people who, by and large, are just trying to do their job in a negative light. Of course, I have the privilege of being white. ||| Being open to diverse viewpoints is critically important, but blindly swallowing and regurgitating the opinions of the group is dangerous. Do you have any feelings on the availability of semi-automatic rifles? ||| I agree. I think that people are very quick to assign blame and knee jerk into a quick fix, but slow to address the roots of social problems that are driving the shooters to behave in such a violent manner. ||| Yeah, I actually saw that headline. The stark reality is that even though we are now all superficially tethered together by the world wide web, the world is more alienating and lonesome than ever before. This is done with purpose, because those feelings drive humans to consume in order to fill that void. ||| I don't participate in social media. When I was a kid I had a Myspace, but my involvement ended after that. Thus far I think that it has been a net negative for our society and I'm glad to have come up before it was so ubiquitous. How about you? ||| Nice talking to you also! bye ||| yeah, it just goes to show that you can never really know what people are going through behind the scenes. ||| the dog too! ||| True, thinking of all the wasted potential is truly depressing. They didn't really go into detail about the domestic abuse, but someone doesn't just turn into a murderer over night. ||| Exactly, the fact he thought a trip to Disneyland was going to fix deeply rooted problems in his marriage was pretty pathetic. ||| Have you ever been in an abusive relationship? ||| yes, actually. I went through a long period of rationalizing their behavior before I cut it off though. ||| yep, plus lots of gas lighting. So, do you think the husband would have reacted differently if his wife had just stolen away with the kids? ||| Do you think he was aware of her facebook posts? ||| yeah, I thought that was a mistake on her part. I can understand how trapped she must have felt though and needed to have her feelings validated. ||| definitely, well thanks for chatting! bye ||| Those poor children and that poor dog. ||| Yeah, poor pup didn't do anything wrong. Also, who decides that a trip to Disney World is going to resolve deeply rooted marital issues? ||| The vast majority of people who suffer from mental illnesses, myself included, are not violent in any way. It's the exceptional outliers that get all the attention. ||| The stigma surrounding mental illness is inexcusable and unfounded, but bolstered by books, movies and television. So, the average person has no idea how warped their perception really is. ||| And more social integration. Anyway, do you think the husband knew that his wife was broadcasting her intentions on Facebook? ||| You have to be an exceptional kind of depraved to murder your own children in cold blood, but yeah, I keep coming back to the dog. ||| Maybe the dog tried to intervene as she was murdering the only family the dog had. ||| Or, perhaps she never liked the dog and had a grudge against it for one reason or another. Did the article mention if the woman worked? ||| No kidding. I wonder if their home was sold or destroyed. ||| bye ||| I think the situation is very troubling. How about you? ||| unfortunately, the government regularly fails in its intended duties. It's crazy to me that people in Flint are still having to use bottled water for everything. ||| it's been years now and those in power are still failing to act. You'd think there'd be some actor willing to take up the cause to get the problem fixed, but I think the problem stems from corporate interest. ||| Have you ever been in a situation where tap water was unsafe to drink? ||| it was safe to bathe and like brush your teeth with though, right? ||| yeah, I spent some time in Central America and everyone just uses those big blue bottles for drinking water. ||| yeah, it's purified water that you can get delivered or just buy from the supermarket. Water from the tap is safe to bathe in but imbibing it can make you sick. ||| right? It's definitely a luxury that we take for granted. ||| yeah, lead is much more detrimental than other contaminants. It can actually kill you. ||| because the problem is not widespread enough, yet. Thanks for chatting with me. Hope you have a great afternoon! bye"
p031,"American system is really messed up. We let illegals get away with so many things and yet, this man, who was adopted and lived here almost his entire life, is facing deportation! He has a family of his own and I'm sure spent a good portion of his career paying taxes to the American government and now his life is in jeopardy-he has a family who is facing losing everything if he goes away!  ||| Fell terrible for marine life that will be exterminated by this terrible spill. Humans have harmed so many wonderful species through their carelessness and selfish attitude. I just hope that the clean-up will be fast an effective but unfortunately this type of oil is the most dangerous to these innocent creatures. Makes you think about how vulnerable God made animals-he entrusted us to keep them but I think he had too much faith in humanity! ||| This is so sad and tragic. The most selfish thing to do is to take innocent lives, especially your own wife and kids! If this man had a mental breakdown over losing his wife he should have went to see a shrink and worked it out with his spouse. His kids were innocent and he denied them their lives. This was the most un-Godly and cowardly thing to do and I just have no words. I feel nothing but anger towards this man and extreme pity towards his wife and kids. ||| You can never trust Russian government. Putin usually \cleans up\"" anyone who is again him or not \""useful\"". A guy does not \""accidentally\"" die in a hotel from mysterious injuries-he gets taken out. Anyone who buys this story is out of their mind. Dictators and communists always take out people who are against them!"" ||| Going to the middle East was the worst decision for our country! Not only do we send soldiers over there to lose their lives but millions of innocent civilians get killed. This war is a fake war-it's all about the oil and political interest and the innocent suffer as a result. The best thing we can do is to leave these people alone and let them live. We need to focus on own own country and stop our evil deeds overseas. ||| My heart goes out to these poor kids-they are just innocent pawns in this terrible world of war, injustice and corruption. Shame on French authorities for putting them in such awful conditions. However, immigration issue is another thing that needs to be considered here, we cannot help everyone, so, instead, we need to help them fix their own country instead of coming over somewhere else and suffering! ||| What a terrible story, my heart goes out to the family of the victim. I wonder what he did to deserve this, was he involved in some way or did something to provoke this senseless murder? Either way, an innocent life is lost and the guy left behind two kids and his wife. The most pathetic thing about it that the murderer killed himself afterwards. What a coward! Hell is definitely a place for people of this caliber. ||| It's amazing that people still debate the issue of gun rights. If someone had a gun at that station, they would have taken out the crazy lunatic who opened fire. Instead, there was one tragic fatality, a 70-year old man, an innocent life taken out so suddenly and he did not deserve this end, I'm sure. People need to stop this political correctness and resort back to logic: we need to protect ourselves and our families, no ifs or buts! There is no time to rely on the police or the government to bail us out-our sefty is in our own hands people!","I'm just disgusted with this war-that we have to sacrifice our soldiers and innocents civilians as well ||| we have no business being there ||| I saw a TV program when they interviews people from Afghanistan and they said, with tears in their eyes, that their way of life was perfectly fine before we came in and brought destruction ||| yes, we-our military are pawns and slaves who serve the evil political interests (mainly the oil or their money over in the middle east) ||| well, with Trump being held up and constantly sabotaged, I don't know when he'll ever get to it ||| yes, so many young lives and potential lost for nothing ||| I don;t know about that-but what we can do is to help them rebuild their own, because right now our own country cannot take on any more burden-we have so many issues with our own poor and homeless and the economy! ||| yes, they have plenty of resources ||| No, not presently, but my husband's father served in Vietnam War and saw a lot of horror ||| Thank you, god bless, goodbye! ||| my heart goes out to these innocent kids ||| these children are just pawns in the game of war, corruption and politics-shame on the French authorities ||| people of France need to protest and go in there and do something, however, it's a greater problem-France should have never allowed them to come in the first place! We cannot continue to solve problems of immigrants but rather help them fix their own country so they don't end up in this situation in the first place! ||| no, I fully agree with you-we have to take care of ourselves before helping others, otherwise everyone goes down! ||| amen to that! Look at our economy-disgrace, we have homeless camps in San Fransisco and yet we allow Mexican immigrants to march over and pay their rent, medical and food-no words! ||| yes, even worst-full of crime and uneducated, they want these people here so they can vote and elect corrupt government who will control the population! ||| I do too, they don;t deserve this! ||| hopefully they will have a chance at better life once they make it out of this situation ||| we need to focus on us now, or we will end up as migrants ourselves! ||| thank you for talking with me today, God bless you and goodbye ||| what a terrible situation, we let illegals get away with so much and yet an innocent man like this gets his whole life taken away! ||| absolutely! We deport good people who paid hard-earned tax money to our corrupt government and let illegals stay while paying their rent, health care and schooling ||| hopefully this administration will change this country for the best ||| I agree with you, my heart goes out to his innocent child and wife, the government isn't going to take care of them ||| yes, I hope he is shown clemency and justice ||| how terrible-and we call ourselves a democracy, in so many ways we are still a corrupt dictatorship! ||| or my neighbor, who was a war vet and 72 could not get his appendix removed because his insurance would not pay for it, so in order to get his operation, he laid himself out on the street corner when it burst and finally an ambulance took him to the hospital and he got it fixed! ||| nope, especially if you got something serious going on, good luck! And these morons in the government are pushing medicaid-type of universal care, it's already bad as it is and they want to downgrade it even further. That's because they have never went to a medicaid doctor and do not know what it is! ||| by incompetent people-like the illegals they let in in order to vote them in! ||| yes, so it's time to stop this and focus on the needs of our own people-even if we look like a \bad guy\"" by not letting them in!"" ||| yes, look at San Francisco, and it's 2019! ||| thank you same here, bye ||| Live is so short and you never know what will happen next-that's why we always need to cherish our kids and tell them we love them! ||| The quote: \if you want to make God laugh tell Him about your plans\"" describes it perfectly!"" ||| just makes you wonder why young and innocent kids die like that ||| God does have a reason for everything, even if unknown to us ||| He loves us-in times like this, however, you do hope that there is some form of reincarnation for those little souls to give them another chance-many people believe in that ||| even if they do not get reincarnated they will be in heaven, that's the ultimate reward, so it's not the end ||| There is certainly heaven and hell and we all go back home to our God ||| He always watches over you-even in your darkest hour, otherwise you would not have the miracle of this life or experience any of its blessings! That's why you;re here, living and breathing ||| That is not true-God gives us free will and your sorrows result from the errors that you make. He only wants to see you succeed and what is best for you, just like a father and mother would want the best for their child. Once you find your ultimate and correct path, he will bless you abundantly and things will fall into place! ||| I was also wondering why this man was targeted? Was he involved in something shady or was he picked randomly by the shooter? ||| they never tell public the truth anyway, just like the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, everyone knows that's not what happened, fake news ||| yes, very true, however, anyone who is serious about doing something can smuggle one weapon or another and there is no way to stop it-those people are clever and won;t be discovered easily! ||| no, anyone can drive up there, he probably had his guns in the car ||| that's why it sounds fishy to me-only one man was targeted, why? ||| that's exactly what I'm thinking, but they made it sound like the victim was an exemplary husband, father, etc., who was suddenly taken out ||| to close the case and spread fake news to the public, regular sources of news cannot be trusted, period, it's like hearing made up fairy tales there's maybe 20% of truth all in all! ||| yes, you have really dig on the internet to get to the bottom, we will be shocked 20-25 years from now of what really went on! ||| very true, some day they will have to re-write the entire history ||| exactly, instead of X-raying and groping harmless people who want to bring baby food on the plane! ||| Israel has the most secure airports in the world, they got their system down pretty good, US should do the same ||| I'm not sure, but I know they got everything combed carefully-including their parking, not one person gets passed without a scan or a check ||| that's a good idea, but wait-people will cry like babies and us racists if we start racial profiling, they find everything offensive ||| society needs to focus more on people and less racism etc. we have greater issues to tackle! ||| yes, whatever the reason my heart goes out to the family left behind, he had two kids ||| as for the murderer, he was a coward, did his crime and took himself out, very pathetic ||| goodbye and thanks for chatting ! ||| 7924832535 ||| I feel so bad and guilty at the same time because of humans. ||| I agree! Humans are causing lots of animals deaths with plastic, pollution, just everything ||| Do you think humans should have more rights than animals ||| That's interesting! Hopefully humans can realize that we need to work collectively to save animals ||| Wow! This is a fact i didn't know. Would you accept a tax or fine for people that litter and dont recycle? ||| Same here. Maybe we will try to do more in the future. Most if not all countries in Asia are going green! ||| True. The whole world is responsible and i hope we can realize that! ||| Hmm what do you think Americans can do to help then ||| Hopefully we can do something so we can stop the extinction of these animals! ||| Yup! It was nice talking to you. bye ||| very tragic ||| not at all, the lunatic, however, should have been taken out right then and there if someone had a gun ||| I agree with checks, but as you know they don;t stop the real criminals, look at Chicago metro area  or New York-teaming with guns even though it is illegal.That's why people need to be able to protect themselves. ||| Yes, I agree. But at least in the US we have guns and I don;t think that will ever change, God forbid we'll end up like Europe-completely defenseless! ||| people will start a civil war if they ever try ||| so while Trump in in the house, guns are safe ||| it's the annoying fake news that pump people full of crazy ideas on TV ||| there's plenty of good sources on the net to get the truth and even then you have to filter things out ||| I feel the same, gun rights are people's rights as long as everything is legal and there is a background check and registration ||| same here, thank you and goodbye ||| what a tragic story ||| I feel extreme pity for the kids and wife but nothing but anger for the husband-he is a coward for taking his young kids' lives! ||| yes! He could have worked things out with some counseling. If his wife did not want to be with him he did not have to kill everybody! ||| I think the wife should have left him sooner, maybe the kids would still be alive today. When someone is abusive you just pack up and leave without even have them suspect anything-things can turn pretty ugly with abusive and mental people and there is no telling what they can do! ||| yes, the wife should have seen this as a red flag but I guess everybody thinks that their husband, no matter how abusive will kill them and their children ||| I came across people like that in relationships and cut it off right away, luckily, have you? ||| it's understandable-that's what abusers do, some of them are very charismatic and make us believe that they are angles and your're the problem ||| maybe if she went to stay with a family and went away to a disclosed location, it would stop him from killing everyone-if he just wanted to take his life, fine, go ahead! ||| of course, it's all public, that probably ignited the fire even more, she should not have done it ||| she should have done it privately. however, damage is done and he stole his kids lives, tragic and pathetic ||| thank you bye ||| I don't buy this story of a guy \accidentally \"" dying in a hotel"" ||| we know that Russian dictators take out anyone who is against them ||| or the guy who got poisoned a while ago, they slipped something in his tea ||| or they simply don;t care, I recall they shot somebody last year in Ukraine, in the broad day light! ||| yes, that's why USA still remains the safest place to live at this day and age-we are not perfect but at least we have rights vs countries like Russia who seem \democratic\"" and yet people are totally oppressed"" ||| well, luckily we now have Trump in the house, I don;t think he will allow any garbage like this-we still have our rights and guns, thank God! ||| I just stay away from political discussions around people because you know how they feel about Trump-but anyone with clear head knows he is good for this country-so let them get offended while he tries to give them jobs and fix their lives! ||| fake news-as Trump himself calls it. I stay away from TV as much as possible-they try to control and brainwash people, especially these young and impressionable minds. ||| yes, better to stay away, lots of negativity and deranged people out there ||| Bernie is a crazy but job-on top of that he is a filthy rich person that most of these silly people don;t know, he always beats himself on the chest like he was poor and knows what it's like but the guy has mansions all over the place ||| precisely, anyone who wants to see him elected is out of their mind. there will be a communism. ||| unfortunately not ||| thank you, I will look into it ||| same here, thank you and God bless, goodbye!"
p032,"I just read a story about the death of a Chinese female fighter pilot. It wasn't made clear exactly what happened - apart from a plane crash - but she is being hailed a hero. I was amazed that China would allow women to hold that kind of position - shockingly modern of them. And that she was widely respected warms my heart. ||| I just read about two young women in France who took their lives after being bullied. I remember being bullied and I can't tell you how glad I am that we did not have social media back in the 80s. The cruelty of kids towards other kids is horrifying. We ask where the parents are for the bullied, but where are the parents of the bullies? ||| While we do think about the human suffering caused by war and poverty, we rarely consider the effects these have on animals. It just makes these situations all the more heartbreaking. When I think about animals in zoos - animals that have been removed from their native lands, only to starve to death. I'm suprised more animal rights groups haven't become involved - really, if all those angry vegans out there spent more time helping animals and less time pontificating to the rest of us, they would do far more good.","Me, too. We think about the effects of poverty, war on humans ... but not animals. ||| That's an excellent point. The owners can't change the situation, that isn't fair at all. It isn't as if they want their animals to be sick/die! ||| Agreed - I would imagine that would provide a more humane death than starvation/malnutrition. Do you consider yourself to be an animal lover? ||| Absolutely. My grad degree is in Animal Behavior. :)  Do you have any pets? ||| Nice! Do they get along? ||| That is a lot of dog to babysit! Is your dog a large breed, too? ||| I just googled Catahoulas - what gorgeous dogs! And I thought I knew my dog breeds. :) ||| What's his temperament like? ||| Sounds wonderful - and sounds like you lucked out! Did you adopt him through a special service? ||| That's even better. I ask because I have friends who adopted a dog that was being trained as a mobility assistant - but he failed the final test after pulling someone out of a wheelchair to chase a rabbit. :) ||| Right? And irresistable! ||| LOL, seriously! That would have made for an unpleasant surprise for the new owner ||| He was - they taught him to sort recycling (that's Seattle for you) and he was the ring bearer at their wedding ||| It was absurdly sweet ||| I do - I'm not sure what happened, but I have cats ... 5 cats. It's a bit terrifying. And, yes, thanks for asking! I'm technically a \primatologist\"" - I ran around watching monkeys"" ||| Nice! I work with some folks doing applied animal behavior with dogs. Cool stuff. And I teach at community college, so I'm right there with you! :) ||| Right back at you! Have a lovely day! ||| bye! ||| Hi there - I was very surprised to find out that China allowed women to become pilots at all ||| Agreed. What are the odds of that happening? ||| Definitely. Do you have any experience in aviation? ||| Absolutely - so someone messed up big time. It was heartwarming to hear that she is broadly seen as a hero ||| Yeah, sadly, I don't think of China as being at the forefront of the feminist movement. ;) I'm shocked women are let near a cockpit! ||| Nope. I just didn't think that women would been seen as capable enough to fly airplanes within that cultural context. ||| That's a great question. I don't know that there are a lot, but I don't think they are entirely rare, either. But I'm really talking out of my rear here. :) I don't know much about the military - do you? ||| Interesting, I hadn't thought of that! In what ways do you think they would be different? ||| Right. That makes sense. Switching gears: what do you think of the officials being unable to assign fault for the death? Wasn't the reason clear? ||| The whole thing is sad. I wonder what protocol changes will be made (if any) because of it ||| That seems like a good place to start ||| I hadn't thought of that. Maybe? I don't think it would keep women from wanting to become pilots - flying is always risky - but I wonder if public opinion will turn against women flying. What do you think? ||| I wonder if anything like this has happened to male pilots in China? Would that story be a big deal like this one? ||| In China or in general? ||| That's probably true, although I think the way that it happened would get press if it happened in the US. Such a freak occurrance ||| I would actually say yes, but I bet there would be more press/sympathy if it was a woman ||| LOL, me too. We've hit 15, so - have a nice day! bye ||| Hi there - the cruelty of kids towards other kids can be truly horrifying ||| That is the truth! Where are the parents - not just of the kids being bullied, but of othe bullies themselves?f the ||| Sorry about that typo. Why do you think parents don't seem to be willing to be more engaged in their kids' lives? Are the adults too busy, they don't want to intrude, they just want to be buddies with their kids... ||| I'm sure that's a big part of it. Maybe parents don't know how to deal with the online/social media world, either ||| That's a great question. There should be some form of punishment but that must include some empathy training. What do you think? ||| There should probably be school-wide programs to try to prevent all this in the first place. I wonder how clearly this issue is being addressed in US schools? ||| It's scary to consider! Must be closer to 100% here.  I'm old enough that there was no social media when I was in school and I'm so freaking grateful for that! ||| Exactly. It would be scary as hell to be in school these days. Funny, I always think of this as a US problem, but I shouldn't be surprised that it's a major issue in Europe, too ||| Hooray for technology! ||| You know, I'm not sure. I'm not a parent; beyond being furious, I want to say that I would get in touch with school officials and try to get all the parents involved.  I would give my kid the option to change schools or maybe be homeschooled....? What about you? ||| That's the thing -  we can get everyone involved, but that won't fix the issue for the bullied person. It's unfair, really ||| Therapy, maybe. Lots and lots of therapy. ||| If you can find a good therapist. But that's a whole other issue :) What is it that makes kids into bullies in the first place? ||| No doubt. Acting out their anger/frustration on other kids instead of their parents. *sigh* ||| No, I agree, they're still just kids. Parents need to step up ||| bye"
p033,"I just read this article about the exploitation of Orangutan habitat in Indonesia and it is alarming. Orangutan are not just any animals, they are one of the smartest and closely related to us. I am sure, you would have watched some documentary where it is shown how evolved they are as a society and how familiar they look to us when caring for their children for instance. It is just so sad that this is happening and I wish we as a race would show more empathy and concern for these magnificent creatures. ||| Read this alarming story about frog populations getting the deadly virus due to garden ponds to some extent. I know we always or mostly mean well but this story amply displayed how when we interfere with natural order of things even with the best of intentions, we can make the matters worse. People were inadvertently spreading the virus beyond the natural reach of infected frog population which in turn was destroying other harmless and healthy frog groups. I think this is a great example of how we should always think twice before taking even the simplest benevolent action towards nature. ||| Just saw this news story about an old lady who was confusingly wandering without proper clothes late at night and and thought I would share it with you. As we move well into our 30's, the cruelness of old age seems to be becoming clearer and clearer. Maybe there were other reasons for her state but my immediate reaction was that it was due to age related general loss of senses and awareness. May we help those of us who need help in such state and may our old age be free from such sad endings.","it does and in this case our intervention seems to have made it worse ||| even with the best of intentions like here, we just end up doing more bad than good ||| true, can't really expect a normal person to know that a garden pond he made few weeks ago had damaged frog population in his area. definitely need to educate people more on these things ||| I guess, their diet is mostly insects so maybe they do control the balance of them in nature and then off course they themselves are diet to others such as snakes ||| oh yes. mosquitoes are just so troublesome so anything to control them should get my vote too. That being said, frogs just seem so harmless and to see them getting killed the way described must be so bad ||| frogs bring so many good memories for me, when i was a kid and our area would get flooded after rain, we would catch these small fish but only later did i get to know that those were not fish at all ||| thinking of this story though, there are those other deadly diseases that we got from the other animals but now they are killing us too ||| And we are mostly running the system but sometimes it just feels that we can never won, there is always some new virus or bacteria that nature throws at us and we start from ground zero again and again ||| Someone I know recently got sick with one of those superbugs and barely survived. I keep thinking to what will be the future like when those become the norm than the exceptions in hospitals ||| Probably very low since we do have some defense even for those. Plagues of old time were just so bad and humans helpless as they did not understood they causes of what was happening and why ||| you too. goodbye ||| that's right. Also they did the right thing to send her for medical checkup ||| Can't imagine what would they be going through if she was indeed sick with dementia or something ||| People are definitely living longer and though we are getting better physical treatments but brain seems to age at its separate pace ||| I hope so, when I think about the old age this is the thing I most fear about. Losing memories of all your life slowly but progressively would really be terrorizing ||| It must really be a tough time, my grandmother too had dementia but this is something that is really hard to live through I guess. Hard for someone to imagine the pain as it is not a physical one ||| True, Just couple of days ago I learned that Alzheimer patients may die due to suffocation as their brain my forget how to breathe. Don't know how true that is but that is one scary state ||| Exactly, I was thinking about that some time ago, it's like children but when we deal with children we do so with hope that they will learn and growup but there is no hope for those old patients ||| It's definitely going to be a bigger problem as people live longer and longer. ||| Police really have a difficult job, you can do 1000's of such acts in your career but what will be remembered is one less than perfect act. I just hope that the lady in this story gets the help she obviously needs after her rescue ||| Right, I wonder if the govt should get involved in these scenarios somehow. But then what really can they do to provide ease such families ||| Hopefully you will have a nice one too. goodbye"
p034,"Did you see Shannon Doherty's interview about cancer? I related to so much of what she said, about letting go of who she thought she was supposed to be and also about how she would look at her husband and think how sorry she was. I know exactly how that feels. Who would have thought Brenda would still have an impact on me 25 years later.","Yes it was both. ||| It always hits me especially hard when it was a celeb I liked as a kid. I guess because as a kid you think the stars are invincible. ||| I was especially sad to hear how she feels bad when she looks at her husband, she feels guilty while he must just be so worried ||| My sister in law just beat breast cancer but she had to go through chemo and radiation ||| I went through it but not for cancer. I have an autoimmune disease and they tried chemo on it. I felt like I was dying for 7 months. It completely wiped me out. It sucks. ||| Not at all! And for me it was experimental. To have that as the ONLY choice and know your odds aren't good anyway? I can't imagine. Some people have tiny survival rates, it's so sad. ||| No, I hear people say all the time they won't put themselves through chemo and I don't blame them. But a lot of cancers are beatable, so people try to hold on to hope. It's hard. ||| That's terrifying ||| I could not handle seeing my spouse go through that. I think it's harder than being sick yourself. ||| It's so emotionally draining when someone you love is sick becaue you just want them to be ok but it's so hard to keep yourself going ||| Hospitals are already so depressing and also frustrating at times. never mind when your loved one is sick. ||| omg yes. Ambulance rides especially! Right at the time you're already stressed. ||| And so is insurance which is the only hope you have of staying out of debt ||| What sucks is just when you are stressed and worried, you have to deal with all of it and it's so complicated. SO many times the insurance and hospital won't communicate so you have to deal with all the calls and everything yourself ||| lol yes. THere's so much more to being sick than just being sick. ||| bye"
p035,"It breaks my heart to see people living in those conditions. I hope that all the aid that was sent to the island makes it to the people who need it the most. I do not know what I would do it that was my family and I. I would hope that I would do my best, but I can see how depressing and hopeless you could feel having your whole life changed because of a storm and not knowing where your next meal is coming from. ||| From reading the article, it looks like the world lost a kindhearted and generous person. If no drugs or alcohol were involved in the accident. I wonder what happen to make them crash. I wonder if it was common to be on the boat with no life jacket. The life jacket may not even mattered because of the speed and the rocks. ||| This article made me think about something that I have never thought about before. Returning to a place where a war happen is not only the repairing of the physical, but the place may have memories that you may never want to return to. For some reason, I always thought that people would just be able to return when the fighting stopped.  ||| The sights and sounds of war are horrible and I would never blame a person for having PTSD. I'm happy that the one solider although he has PTSD, he is working though it and wants to show people that now all people with PTSD are dangerous and there is away to heal yourself after being in a such bad of a place. ||| It is nice for her to share her journey with cancer. I like how both of them connected with each other. I know that cancer is a sad thing and I'm happy they she found a way to change how she thinks about herself and thinks about life. It was interesting to see how she thought about her husband during that time. ||| I do not know how to feel about this story. It is one of  those stories where I blame the parents and do not blame the parents at the same time. I naturally  worry all the time and would had made sure that the window was not open enough for the 2 year old to fall out and I do know that accidents happen. The parents must be heartbroken. ||| It makes me sad that people have to risk their life to get help. It makes me madder that those people are turned away for their search for a better life. It is human history for people to be able to move around and search for a better life. Now with boarders people are stuck in the place that they are born.   ||| I guess I feel sad for any person who feel they do not fix into their marriage. I hope he found what he was looking for with another person. I hope they both find happiness. In the world today marriages do not seem like they are built to last. I think people give up too easily and do not work through the hard times. ||| This story did not move me. The story is a little bit sad because of the marriage being broken up and that it not a good thing. It is a good thing that the two children are over 18 and do not have to grow up without both parents being together. The thing about being a hot dad has nothing to do with the story. It is more about the marriage breaking up. ||| Why would people go to Norway to mess with the polar bears? I do not understand what people are thinking sometimes. I wish people would just leave the polar bears and other animals alone for they can live their life just as people live their life. I hope one day the population of polar bears comes back up to normal. ||| It hurts my heart to think about all the people who leave the place of their birth only not to find a home that they are looking for. I would love to see the day were people treat all other humans like people no matter how they look and where they are from. I wonder why people can not relate to other people and just help. ||| To me this is a hard story to think about. First thing I think about when I hear wind turbines is clean and green power, which in my opinion is a good thing. I would have never thought that they would be killing eagles and bats. This is a hard because we use wind to help the environment, but the turbines are hurting flying animals.  ||| It was very sad what happened in Paris. I think the terrorist are cowards. I would hate to find out after all the worrying and not being able to reach my child that they had died on social media. It was very sad to read about and feel the father's emotions about his daughter.  I was happy that he found some peace with his lost. ||| I feel sorry for the dog. I think it is the owner's fault that the dog was killed. The man could have handled it better, but he was within his rights to shoot the dog for his protection. The owner should have kept her dog on a better leash and not let the dog run freely in the park. Hopefully the owner will learn from this. ||| I learned something new about garden ponds and their role in spreading infections in frogs and fish. The frog population his been effected by urban garden ponds and people moving frogs from pond to pond. The frogs do not seem to be recovering from the diseases that is spreading. I wonder how many people in England will read this and stop having a garden pond. ||| As a man, I could never understand why a man would want to grab or touch a woman without her wanting them to. I wonder if there is a connection between wanting to be in a high position and have high status and the feeling like you can do anything you want. I feel sorry for any woman that has been in this situation.  ||| I feel sad for all the people who are being turned into human shields in Iraq. The article made me think about how good we have it in the United States and things that are happening to these people are only seen in movies.  To be shot dead on the spot for protesting or have more than half of your family missing because they were kidnapped would be horrible. ||| I feel sorry for the people living in that region. I hate that children have to go through that and have a life of war and no hope. I hope the UN helps the people with root of the problem and helps them get jobs,food, shelter, and healthcare. I hope the European countries allow some of the people to stay to take the pressure off their home countries. ||| This one is hard for me to think about. I can see both sides of this one. One, the two anti poachers are trying to save the animals, which I think is a good thing. The other people are trying to make a living in a harsh environment and the rest of the world is based on capitalism where resources are used to make as much money as possible.  ||| I feel very sorry of the Afghan civilians that were killed by our military. This is why I hate war. I know some people will say war is war, which is true, but that does not make it any better.  I feel like this type of thing is what makes more terrorist. I know I would want to get revenge on the people who killed my family. ||| The ban on smoking outdoors in the article takes place in England, but the same thinking could happen in the United States. I do not like the ban. I do not smoke or want my children smoking, but what other adults do with their bodies is their business. If there is proof that smoking in an outdoor space hurts others, then it should be banned. If it only hurts the smoker, then it should be allowed. ||| Second hand smoke is a bad things and I'm glad it is banned from around children.  I do not want the government to have the power to tell people what to do with their bodies. I do not like smoking, but I think that every adult should have the right to do whatever they want with their body. I think smoking should only be banned if it harms other people. ||| I think that two things can be true at one time. I think that giving aid to the people to fight the disease can be a good things and I also think that cleaning the water supply for the people would not have to deal with the disease in the future is also a good thing. I lean more towards fixing the problem long term but short term help is also good. ||| I feel very sorry for the girl who lost her eye slight to the pallet gun. It is a new way of thinking about non deathly weapons. I think the girl's father was right and wrong at the same time. I think it is better that she was not killed, but I understand his and her pain about her losing the ability to see and how it changed her life. ||| I believe that the United States should not back any government that makes that many mistakes in its airstrikes. I also think the United States should update its policy of using airstrikes. It seems to me that more civilians are being killed than the people who are being targeted.  I feel sorry for the people in Yemen who just want to live a normal life and can not because of the war. ||| I feel very bad for the people killed. I can only imagine going to get some fuel and having the truck blow up killing me and many others. I do not know if the death was quick or slow  and painful as you burned to death. I hope it was an accident and not cause by someone on purpose, but that does not really matter to the victims that died. ||| I do not like reading stories like this one. It makes me think about my use of fuel and it is hard to point the finger at somebody else damaging the environment. I think as humans we have a long way to go in figuring our the right balance between how we us the resources of the earth and how we respect the other animals on this planet.  ||| I think this is combination of human climate change and messing with the rivers. I do think that droughts are natural and some times happens, but I think that human involvement in the river is the main cause of the river running dry. I think that human are going to mess with the river ecosystem and it may never return to normal.  ||| In my opinion, this is a mistake that can not happen. Killing civilians at a doctors without boarders camp has no excuse. I agree with doctors without boarders that this is a war crime. I wonder what discipline happened to the sixteen service members. It was wrong to stop the people protesting with the bodies, they have a right to show their anger.  ||| I feel sorry for the troops that lost their lives. I do not believe we should be in the middle east, but the troops are not making those choices. I do not see how you have a shoot out with a country that you are supporting. I know there is a language barrier, but this should have never happen. I wonder is something else is going on.  ||| I always worried about traveling in an airplane, but the recent news and this article makes me think twice about traveling by train. I feel very sorry of the four people who lost their life and the fifty injuries  in the train wreck.  I hope they find out what caused the wreck for it does not happen again.  ||| This was a very short article without a lot of context to it. It did not tell why the man with the assault style weapon killed the man that was in his seventy's. At first, I thought it was going to be about a man that was denied the right to vote, but that story proved to be false.  I do feel sorry for any body who loses their life to gun violence.  ||| I'm feel for a person that kill themselves. I feel that everybody has the right to make that choice because it is their life and they are the one's that have to deal with their feeling emotional or physical.  The article did not go into great detail about the man, but I hope his family or anybody else are not suffering. ||| I think having cities in the United States with bad drinking water is bad for the entire nation and should be address by the entire nation. I think there should be real punishment for the people in charge that do not make sure that the city has clean drinking water. I'm sad to read all the stats about other cities having the same issue. ||| Any time an official or aid is found death from Russia or another major country, I feel like they did not die or natural causes. The story said the aid died from drinking too much then falling. I could believe that if the story did not say that the aid fell more than one time. I can see one fall hitting your head then dying, but I can not see more than one fall. ||| India is being effected by a capitalist mindset. The money and power generated by the coal mines seems to be more important than human life along with the lives of local animals. Humans and elephants are suffering because of the coal mines. The lost of habitat for the elephants is driving them into local villages in search for food. Human are being compensated very little for the lost of land. It sad all around. ||| I feel bad for the elephants and the people who live next to the mines in India. I know that America used a lot of coal as it was industrializing, so it is hard for me to blame India for what they are doing to the people and animals.  It seems like the people are promised and do not get so little compensation for their lost due to the coal mines. ||| Depression is a major factor in all of our lives. I believe that everybody gets depressed it is that some of us are better with dealing with it. She took her own life after being a very successfully person. It shows me that money,worth and fame do not matter when it comes to depression. It is sad that she did not get the help she needed in time. ||| I still remember that day when the shooting in Paris happened.  I'm happy that the band went back and spoke with the people in the town hall meeting. I was a little sad by the comments made by the one band member stating that he believed that Muslim security helped the shooters.That kind of thinking is hurtful. The people who did the shooting are monsters, but that does not include all Muslims.  ||| I feel sorry for the people who lost their life during something that didn't really have anything to do with them. I thank the band the eagles for going back and performing for the people. I do not see what the terrorist get from this. It makes their religion more hateful. I know that a cartoon was drawn that was very disrespectful but this is not the answer. ||| I'm happy that France has setup some anti bulling measures.  I'm sad for the children who took their own life and the parents and other family members that are left behind to deal with the aftermath. Hopefully the hotline will help a child with the bulling and depression that they are dealing with and they get the help that this needed. ||| It makes me mad they the did not shut the ride down and really figure out what was wrong with it. I feel bad for all of those who lost their lives that day. I feel bad for the daughter that had to watch her mother be killed at the hands of a ride that was suppose to be a fun day for the two of them. I do not how she recovers from that. ||| This worries me every time that I go to a park like this. I know in my mind for the most part they are safe, but I always think about the small percent of an accident like this happening. I feel sorry for the girls. I would hate to lost family members like this and I know is has to be such a traumatizing thing to happen. ||| I feel bad anytime that I read that somebody has lost their life. I feel that the US should not be helping bomb people unless they know they are may one day cause harm to the US. I do not believe in fighting wars as much as I believe in protecting people. People need the US help in many areas and the money for bomb could be spent better.  ||| I really feel for the man and his child that survived the car crash.  I would not wish this type of pain on anybody. I do not know what we can do about it?  Should we put governors on cars that do not allow them to go over a certain speed?  It is a hard fact of life that we can be here one day and be gone tomorrow.  ||| I feel bad for the girls that have to go through this because they are so poor. I hope they all the girls are returned to their families so nobody has to be hurt. It is sad that the police did not help the girls when their families asked for help. I hope that all the captors of the girls go to prison for a very very long time. ||| It was very interesting to me to learn how seabirds hunt. The smell of plastic reminds them of the smell of the foods that they eat and they eat the plastic thinking that they are eating their normal food. I hate that the birds and oceans are being polluted by humans so badly. I hate we are not changing and helping the environment.  ||| The way that the world is setup, countries that are developing have no choice but to harvest their natural resources to make money. I wonder if countries with more money could pay these developing countries to not harvest their natural resources. I feel bad for the orangutans because they are caught in a game of economics. ||| It makes me mad when I hear about people not wanting NFL players to take a knee or when people get mad at Black Lives Matter movement. There is a real problem in America when it comes to how black people at treated by the police. The police are far too often quick to shoot an unarmed black person, but take white mass shooters alive. ||| I feel sorry for the old lady because my grandmother had similar problems. It must be hard when you get old and your mind does not work like it use to. I hope that they find her family or where she came from so she can be returned safety. I know that she was scared and confused because that is what use to happen to my grandmother. ||| I feel bad for all the people that have to leave their home country to try to find a better life. It must be bad for people to take the bad odds of dying at sea instead of staying where they are at. I think it will take an international effort to solve the problems facing all the nations that have so many immigrants leaving. ||| I was impressed by the many first, like being the first AD of the state of Florida. Then becoming the first female Attorney General for the United States of America. For that she will always be remembered.  Some of her dealing with the Clintons and the some of the ways she handled the illegal immigration case of that little boy I do not agree with. ||| I hate that the man had to lose his daughter to such a senseless act of violence. I hope that the man finds peace. I also would not like to find out that my daughter had passed away on social media. Those few hours where they could not get in touch with her had to be the hardest hours in the world and to finally find out on social media had to be heartbreaking. ||| The whole article broke my heart. If I got a text message telling me I have 24 hours to leave my home and all the things that I own, I would not know what to do. Of course I would leave with my wife and children because they are the most important things in my life, but it would be hard to know my house is about to get bombed. Also, paying 40 dollars for a kilogram of meat, I could not afford this and I do not live in a war tore country. I hate this for the people. ||| It makes me angry that people will attack or kill other people just because they have a different religion, race or sexuality. When will people learn that it is okay to be different. I can see how Trump's words give some people the idea that this is okay. Trump is part of the problem and not a part of the answer. ||| I feel very sorry for the children and there families. Eating is one of the basic needs of survival and it looks like there families are trying, but they just can not afford to pay for food. Seeing that supplies for school cost five times the monthly wage was outrageous. I see the situation getting worse before it gets better. ||| Being a parent of young children this story hits me hard. I do not know what I would do if my children could not eat at home or at school. The country has a lot of work to do to get is people the basic things that they need. I feel like government stealing is partly to blame because the county has a lot of oil but the people are not benefiting from it. ||| I have no clue what would make a father kill his own children. I feel very sorry for the two boys. It must be very fearful to around an irrational person especially that person being your own father. I do not want anybody to kill themselves, but if you feel that way take your own life and let other people live theirs.  ||| One of the biggest fears of a parent, is that they die and can not protect their children especially when they are young, like the children in the article.  The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need. ||| It would be a hard decision for me to stay or leave my family. I guess at the older age, I would not want to leave my home. It would be bad for your own government and rebel forces fighting making it hard to get food. I would worry if I had to leave my parent of grandparent alone back in war tore country.  I hope the war ends soon. ||| For the past few years I have been struggling about the ideas of zoos. I know that they are educational, but I think to myself about how the animals feel. I believe that elephants are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. To keep one in isolation is pure cruelty. I have seen elephants cry over the lost of loved ones and they are very communal animals.  ||| I feel bad for the mother and her two daughters that died in the accident. I'm a person that worries and being in a trailer would have me worrying. It is very sad that their life were cut short because they wanted to enjoy sometime together and go for a ride on Halloween.  I hope that the other people involved in the crash find peace. ||| To this day I can not understand people who kill someone then kill themselves. If your life is going that bad and you want to kill yourself then you should do it, but leave other people out of it. I feel bad for the man who lost his life and his children that had to lose their father like that. I even feel bad for all the people at the airport that had their lives interrupted.  ||| Sometimes living in the United States we forget how a lot of the people of the planet live. I would not think about buying fuel from a truck that stops in my community. We think of gas stations, not thinking that everybody in the world do not have access to a gas station. I feel sorry for the people who died and was hurt in the accident. ||| As a father of three girls, I hate to see stories like this one. I know in today's climate people can be convicted in the eyes of the public before an actually trial, but I think this guy did it. It is too many different women saying that he did the same thing to them. It is hard for me to see what any man gets from doing this.  ||| As a father of three women, I hate that the gender gap is nowhere close to closing. I feel like it should be simple, equal pay for equal work. The world is a complex place and I'm glad that some nations are getting it and that they are closing the gender gap. I do still think there are some jobs are require more males than females and that it just because of physical strength. ||| Living in a war tore country must be horrible. I feel the pain of all the lost. Having air strikes hit your home has to be horrible and seeing love ones buried under what is left from your home is also horrible. I do not wish this on anybody. I hope that the country can find peace and the people can return to a normal life. ||| Living in a war tore country must be horrible. I feel the pain of all the lost. Having air strikes hit your home has to be horrible and seeing love ones buried under what is left from your home is also horrible. I do not wish this on anybody. I hope that the country can find peace and the people can return to a normal life. ||| I did not know that the Trump election hit the Jewish community that hard. I guess if my family went through what happened during world war 2, I would also be on the look out for history to repeat it self. I wish that all the communities that were mentioned in the article would band together to support each other.  ||| I think that food waste is a large problem.  I think that American's are lucky to be in position of  having more food than they need, but we do need to start thinking about the environment.  I was surprised that the wasted money factor did not get more people to monitor the amount of food waste that they generated.  ||| I know that the cousin said not to judge Mark, but he did wrong. No matter how he felt he should have not killed his wife and children.  As a father myself, I feel my job is to protect my children at all times. I wish he would have seen a bright future of his children even if he was not married to his wife.  ||| I feel that this will become a national problem soon. I feel that the pipes that built America are getting old and that many cities will suffer the same issues as Flint Michigan. I hope that the people in charge of these cities will be punished for their crimes in my opinion. I believe they knew it was wrong and turned a blind eye. ||| Whenever Russia and Putin are involved  I do not trust what is being said. The story about him being drunk and drinking all day sounds weird. I do not see how he falls and hits his head and then falls over and over causing harm all over his body. I think they was killed, but I do not know why. I feel bad for his family.","I feel very sad for the people. ||| Yeah, the whole situation is horrible. ||| I know we can donate, but it's hard to know exactly how the money is used. ||| No, and You? ||| Sorry to hear that, I'm glad that you are okay! ||| I felt really sorry for the sister that now has to rise her siblings. ||| Yeah, we never know what we can do unless we are tested. ||| Tornado when I was young. They suck too. ||| The power of nature is truly scary. ||| Me too, I wish there was a direct way to aid the people. ||| You too! bye ||| Sounded like a very kindhearted man. ||| I was wondering if no drugs or alcohol were involved what happened? ||| That could have been it. ||| It was nice that he saved his mom not knowing it was her. ||| Yeah, It was nice for the team to get the visa. ||| yeah, so sad that it was cut so short. ||| yeah and did not change much when he got his baseball money. ||| He must had a lot of trust for the driver of the boat. ||| That what I was thinking. It is not a pretty way to die. ||| He was a very good player too. ||| It was nice chatting! bye ||| I feel bad for the people and the wild life. ||| I can not believe how little they said they are going to pay the people for lost of land. ||| That is true. I wonder what other animals besides the elephants are effected? ||| It has to be really bad growing up next to the coal mine with the bad air quality. ||| Nothing seemed to be very regulated. ||| Corruption and greed, but that is not just in India. ||| No, not as bad because of regulations, but I would not want to live next to one. ||| The way the coal in mined. ||| Yeah, the woman losing her son was bad too. ||| Sadly, I think it present day. ||| India is a big country. So it probably has good parts when it comes to environmental protections. ||| The story was about capitalism as much it was about environmentalism ||| You asked about mines in America. I believe this is how they were in the 1800s ||| many people died because of black lung. ||| I would think that they are. ||| You have a great day too. ||| bye ||| I can not blame them for wanting to industrialize, but it still horrible. ||| Yeah, the people and animals over there are suffering. ||| That would be very scary, then told you will get about 120 dollars for your broken leg. ||| It sucks that the people who don't even work in the mines are getting such bad lung diseases. ||| I wonder if the animals are having lung issues too? ||| Like I said, can't get too mad because American used a lot of coal in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s. ||| Many of the same areas want to continue mining coals. It sucks that we live in a world where economics out weight health. ||| I know working in the US mine is a lot safer than the mine in India. ||| Yes 100 percent. ||| I agree, but a lot people can not think about the future or other people besides themselves ||| I would like my children's children to be able to have a good life. ||| No. Very nice chatting with you! bye ||| Me too, depression is a real issue. ||| Yeah that is true, I think she wanted help but the system failed her. ||| It made me think that money and frame does not matter when it comes to depression ||| I wonder if being famous adds more pressure and makes a person depressed? ||| She should have never been left alone. ||| That is true, but they knew she was having thoughts of killing herself. ||| I guess that is why they have professionals. It is a hard subject. ||| I agree, most people see it was weakness and do not understand what is going on. ||| Or tell them how to deal with it. ||| I believe it comes down to people not wanting to be seen as weak. I do not think most people think about depression as chemicals in the brain. ||| Yes, there is a lot more awareness today. ||| Going back to what you said earlier. I feel bad for anybody family that has to go though this. ||| It would be the questions about what should you have done. ||| The internet makes it better and worst. ||| Well, hopeful everybody gets the help they need. ||| nice chatting with you. ||| bye ||| I never thought about the painful memories keeping people from returning. ||| Yes, after wars and what they have seen. ||| How long before the middle east is put back together, I don't think it will be in our lifetime. ||| Yeah it is very sad ||| I agree with that ||| These stories are very sad and make me thankful for my life. ||| Totally ||| I would be. To be told to convert or die is the ultimate test of faith. ||| Very silly to us, but some people do take their faith as life or death. ||| I believe, but I don't fault others for believing different from me. ||| It was very nice chatting with you! bye ||| This is a subject that is near and dear to my heart as my brother served for 12 years and has suffered with PTSD because of it. I think it is our job, as those citizens that receive the freedoms they fight for, that we should do more to make sure we take care of our veterns. ||| I think it should be more than frowned at. We need to focus more on helping our veterans than just about anything else as a society. They are doing what we can't or won't and don't deserve to be forgotten. ||| Exactly and they deserve more from us. We need to make sure PTSD is taken seriously and we do more to help. ||| A facility might be a start, but I think that makes it seem like we want to put them away somewhere so we don't have to see them. I'd rather see more community activities where we interact with them and help them as individuals. ||| I hope that as more people talk about it more people will also seek help. ||| I agree. The more people willing to help. The more our veterans will understand that we want to help them. ||| Exactly. We have to be more willing to talk about this situation so that more veterans will understand that we want to help and that there is help to be found. ||| I agree. If we treat them as humans and not statistics and let them see we can understand their frustrations and issues I'd like to believe we will make a difference. ||| For sure. We need to look at this as a long term commitment and not just a fad of the moment. Our veterans are going to need care for the rest of their lives and they deserve it. ||| If we show that we are willing to understand them after their service. I think it will help those currently serving and those thinking about it. ||| I think one of the most important things to remember and consider is we have to treat each veteran as his own person. The cure isn't a one size fits all and we need to dedicate the time and effort needed to make sure each one is treated personally. ||| I was happy she was strong when dealing with cancer. ||| It was good she was so self looking ||| It made me wonder how I would deal with cancer ||| it had to be scary thinking it was gone to have it come back ||| Yeah, it  is scary that it can happen to anybody no matter the age or sex ||| I can relate to the host because my mom had cancer. ||| Yes, she has to keep getting checked every year. ||| i don know if we had enough turns but we can try. ||| bye ||| I thought it was good. I did not like the statement Hughes made. ||| Me too, Going out to have a good time and have monsters do this to people you love. ||| There is no good reason, but I would never blame all Muslims. ||| Yeah, I liked the love that they showed the people. ||| I agree, nothing can stop the pain from that day. I pray it never happens again. ||| Yeah, the bigger issue of terrorism is very complex ||| Me neither, all life needs to be treated with more respect. ||| I think they will always be people like this. sandy hook and other things like that will never make sense to someone like me or you. ||| Or getting the phone call about a loved one being killed for no reason. ||| I agree, but I can not stress enough that this should not breed hate for others just because their faith. ||| Are you afraid of large events now? ||| No, I'm more worried about my children at school. ||| Yeah, we all should be nice to each other. I think the internet makes us less caring. ||| yeah, they do not treat others with respect. ||| Sadly I do not see them changing anytime soon. ||| You too. ||| bye ||| Yes it was very sad. ||| These past years there has been too many. ||| There was a FBI report about the new Joker movie that is opening soon. ||| Yeah, I know people are blaming the movie, but the movie has nothing to do with it in my eyes. ||| The most chilling for me was Sandy hook. I have two children in elementary right now, it's scary. ||| These shooting are pure evil. ||| I don't like when people kill themselves, but if you feel that way don't take anybody with you. ||| A lot people are angry and feel like they don't fit in. ||| I agree with that. I think the gun problem is too late to stop. ||| Yeah this is a human problem. ||| you too! bye ||| Me too. Hopefully some of the things that they are doing will help children. ||| I agree, but it is a hard issue to deal with. ||| I feel bad for the children and the parents. I have four children and it would break my heart to know they felt like there was no escape. ||| Your right about social media playing a large role now days. ||| I think everybody will deal with something that is part of life. ||| They can not escape the bullying ||| That is true but sometimes a teacher can be part of the problem. I make sure my children know they are loved everyday and home is their safe space. ||| I think any adult seeing a child suffer should step in and help. ||| Plus teach your children to respect others. ||| TV shows really did have better messaging about those kind of things. ||| Shows did a better job in the past in my opinion. It was very nice chatting with you! ||| bye ||| I agree, it was greed by the park. ||| Yes, that is the only way they will change. What do you think? ||| I feel bad for the girl who lost her mother. ||| Yeah, You go to have fun and come home with somebody in your family dead. ||| I'm happy that the two girls made it out alive. ||| I agree, that one day changed her life forever. ||| Yeah they just wanted to make more money. ||| I agree ||| me too, but money really can not fit this ||| bye ||| Very sad and very scary, what do you think? ||| That what I was thinking. Something that was suppose to be fun. ||| It makes me think twice about going to places like that. ||| We are on the same page with that ||| I agree. My i don't let my kids get on local fair rides. ||| I know people die everyday but not all deaths are equal. ||| You only get one for forever. ||| Yeah, I agree with that ||| I think they do daily checks, but I think a death in your park should have big penalties ||| You too! bye ||| I feel bad about the little boy ||| How do you feel about the parents? ||| I think they should be blamed, but losing a child is a lot of punishment. ||| I worry too and always watch my children. ||| I wonder what they were thinking? ||| why do you think that? ||| I agree a little, but the father was at home and odds are this is not the first time the window was open. ||| me either, I hope others learn from this. ||| most newer windows had child locks so the window only opens so much, older windows you should put a stick or stopper in them. ||| you too, bye ||| It makes me sad that people have to risk their life to find a better life. ||| all those people dead:( ||| you do think the people can be helped? ||| why? is not human history to spread out and move around? ||| where? I think the people are doing the best they can. ||| If they had the money to fly, odds are they would not be leaving. ||| I do not think mothers risk their children if they had better options. ||| It reminds me of what is going on in the US. ||| People just searching for a better life for their family. ||| I agree ||| Your right and I believe it could be done. ||| yes, bye ||| I care because it involves human life ||| That is a bad way of looking at things. ||| So you believe there should be no rules in war? ||| so your okay with 911, because they believed they were at war with the US. ||| I would do anything to protect my family, but I do not  go looking for trouble. I'm glad you can see it from an objective point of view because most can not. ||| Without rules and with today's technology we will destroy each other. ||| To be honest, I would like them fight and only give aid to the citizens. ||| Look at the US involvement in the middle east. Iraq is worst and Libya is now a hell hole. ||| We do not live over there, We can not say why they are fighting. We only get news reported to us. I do not think Iran can do any major damage to the US. ||| By your own logic, Israel if full of coach roaches too, (I do not agree) So why care what happens to them? ||| I agree, but we are not messing with Russia or China if we really wanted to go after the bad guys. ||| You too, bye ||| I agree, stories like this one makes me sad. ||| At least one of his children survived. ||| I agree,  I would be broken if I lost my wife and child in one day. ||| His cousin was mentioned, hopefully he has more family. ||| Do you think cars need to have there speed limited? ||| I agree with you. ||| Do you think the driving age should change? ||| I really can not stand people who drink and drive. They are so selfish. ||| Sorry to hear that, glad you are okay. ||| I lost one of my best friends in high school in a car accident. A man had a heart attack and hit her car killing her and two others. ||| Thank you, it drove her parents and sister crazy. I still remember that day like it was yesterday . ||| I drive so safe and always wear my seat belt since that day. ||| I have to drive, but I'm a defensive driver. ||| I think you would be a good driver. ||| You too! bye ||| I'm sorry his marriage did not work out. ||| Money is not always happiness, but I would like to be rich. ||| Not really, You? ||| They are okay actor and actress ||| Besides from what I just read I do not know the details, so I guess so. ||| I know single mothers and I'm a parent. How about you? ||| It would be hard. It is hard with both parents in the house. ||| My mother did a good job with me and my siblings. ||| What do you think about marriage now days? ||| I got married at the court house 18 years ago. ||| Never too old, I'm 37. Just find yourself the right person. ||| you too bye. ||| I'm happy they waited for the children to be over 18 before the marriage broke up. ||| Yeah, long marriages are rare in general. ||| People think everyday will be a fairy tale. ||| when married there will be days you do not want to be married. ||| I got married at 19 and been married for 18 years I know it is not easy. ||| Thanks, my grandmother gave me the advice that I will not be happy everyday. ||| are you married? ||| congratulations! ||| I wonder if being in Hollywood put pressure on their marriage? ||| I use to think Hollywood makes you  weird. ||| I agree. I know who the daughter is in the story. I have no clue about her father. ||| do you think money helps or hurts marriages? ||| I can see your point of view ||| you too! bye ||| I feel bad for the polar bears ||| The article did not have a lot of information. ||| I do not think polar bears are going to make it. ||| I hope their behavior changes, but with the ice melting, I think it is too late. ||| Don't plenty of zoos have polar bears for people to see? ||| Yes, at the Toledo Zoo ||| Yeah, Coke made them cuddly ||| I agree, but sadly we have to worry about humans at the rate we are going with climate change. ||| I hope so ||| I agree, no animal on earth last forever. ||| I agree, dinosaurs had a much longer run. ||| odds are laugh at how greedy we were. ||| Do you think we can change? ||| Sadly I agree ||| can't think of any, bye ||| The world is a crazy place, I feel bad for the girls and their families. ||| Sadly, odds are they are sexually abusing them too. ||| I don't think they have a choice since they are so poor ||| I think they have the hope, but they still might know the danger too. I could see myself sending my daughters away ||| Yeah, I am in America I think most American have no clue how the rest of the world is living. ||| I do think of the or people have the upper hand is some major event happened to the earth. I do not know how to hunt or grow crops so I would be dead pretty quick ||| I wonder why the police would not help the girls at first? ||| Have you been to other countries? I have only been to Canada ||| How were the local people living? ||| I always say you don't miss what you don't know. ||| any other thoughts on the article? ||| I agree with you. It was nice chatting with you! bye ||| I agree, who knew that is how seabirds hunt. ||| Do you think we \human\"" are going to change before it is too late?"" ||| I agree, polar bears and panda are done along with a lot of other species. ||| Do you think people who do not believe in climate protection, really believe we are doing nothing wrong or just being blindly selfish? ||| Countries like China are not going to stop polluting anytime soon. ||| I can see their viewpoint, but they should also learn from our mistakes. ||| Like you said earlier, we are rolling back protections and backed out of the Paris accords. ||| I agree, I'm not an impossible burger person. I would cut back if I knew he would truly help my children's future on this planet. ||| I always envision the movie demolition man where they are eating rats. LOL ||| A lot countries in Asia already eat rats and insects. ||| I would like to see us move away from gas cars. ||| I'm scared of self driving cars. ||| Yeah, but I have never seen a perfect technology. It was nice chatting with you! bye. ||| I feel sorry for all the people who get turned back. ||| I think the solution is to help their home countries. ||| I think people don't realize how bad it has to be for a person to float across the sea on a small boat with 200 other people. ||| Yeah, it makes me grateful for the things that I have. ||| me either, some people take joy in seeing other people have less than them. ||| I don't like that they play favors with certain countries. The world will be a better place when we see each other as one. ||| Hopefully German and the USA will get this right in the future. ||| I totally agree with you. It is inhumane. ||| I think we are in the silent majority. ||| Sadly this country, the world, is built on unfair treatment. ||| Do you have anymore opinions about the article? ||| Okay, nice chatting with you! bye. ||| who knew that wind turbines are killing eagles. ||| It is hard to think about because wind is clean power ||| Yeah, eagles and bats vs everything else. ||| I agree. I wonder what are the downsides to solar. ||| I don't know, but that is a good idea. ||| I read an article about the good side of nuclear power. ||| it is clean and safe if done right ||| what do you think is the best power? ||| you need a lot of solar panels ||| I like natural gas, but it is limited. ||| have you ever seen a wild eagle? ||| Yes, its scary how big they are ||| I would be freaked out too. ||| Yeah, or change the color or been them make a sound the birds don't like ||| Do you have any other points about the article? ||| No, nice chatting with you! bye ||| Me, too. ||| I think they need to pay countries to not harvest their natural resources. ||| I can not blame them for doing what they are doing because that is what we did. ||| Yea, I would hate to lose orangutans ||| Corporations rule the environment ||| What do you think we could do to help them stop? ||| That could work ||| I would pay them to make a large part of the forest a national park. ||| I think that is what they do in Africa for large game parks ||| have you seen an orangutan at a zoo? ||| Yes, they are pretty cool. ||| I really like the elephants too. ||| do you have any other opinions about the article? ||| No, it was really nice chatting with you. bye ||| I agree. How do you think police and race relations can be handled better? ||| This is why NFL players were taking a knee. ||| I know the police know how to take people in alive, look at most mass shooters. ||| I agree that there are good police. I think they should be held to a high standard ||| Yeah, most super rich people do not care what happens to people no matter what their race is. ||| I always wonder when enough money is enough. ||| Jeff Bezos could pay more, but he rather see the fake number go up in his bank account. ||| Can he withdraw 75 billion dollars?. At some point it is just a number in account. I see your point too. ||| Do you think all this class,race is just part of the human condition? ||| I agree. I think people are just scared to let their guard down because they do not want to lose what they have. ||| Hopefully universal basic income. ||| Sadly I have to agree with you. Most American think health care is not a right. ||| Police departments and Fire departments are forms of socialism but people don't complain about them. ||| The government has long stopped working in the interest of the common man. ||| Climate change or an asteroid. ||| Do you think police should be enforcing laws dealing with what an adult does with their own body? ||| I can see how see how some women can be forced into prostitution. I believe all drugs should be legal. I would hate for one of my children to overdose, but I would also hate for one of my children to die from a heart attack from eating Big Macs all day which is not illegal. ||| Do you think we should make police less militarized? ||| Like back in the day when they knew the people's names in the community. ||| I agree with that. ||| Great chatting with you too! goodbye ||| I feel bad for the father in the article. ||| Sadly nothing. There are too many people to control everything. What do you think? ||| It would break my heart to find out my child died on social media. ||| I'm glad he said he was finding some peace in the things he was doing to honor his daughter ||| Do you think publishing the cartoon was the right thing to do. ||| The cartoon drawing of Muhammad ||| I agree. I think attacking is too far, but you should not play with someones religion. Plus the people at the concert did not do the drawing. ||| I agree with you. ||| I also did not like how people blame the actions on all Muslims. ||| I believe in God, but I try not to get too religious ||| Sadly some people go to church every Sunday but still do not have love for everybody. ||| I said that to my mom and she told me heavy sinners need to go to church the most. I couldn't argue with her. ||| You too. bye ||| I blame the dog owner for the dog's death. ||| I feel bad for the dog and her, but I can not blame the man for shooting the dog ||| Yeah, what do you think about the rules of park? ||| No, I support the right to bear arms, but I can not see myself carrying a gun everywhere ||| It would take me a long long time to get another dog. ||| Yeah, she knew she could not really blame the guy for shooting the dog ||| I do not think she needs to become depressed, but it was mainly her fault ||| I agree. I really don't think her dog was going to bite him, but was just an excited dog. ||| Yeah he could had just been afraid of dogs ||| Do you have any pets? ||| I used to but my dog died of old age. ||| Do you have anymore comments about the article? ||| nice chatting with you! bye ||| Who knew backyard ponds could cause so much harm. ||| I knew the pet trade caused bad things for environment and animals ||| and moving frogs from different ponds to ponds. ||| yeah frog are not good pets ||| I agree animals shouldn't be caged ||| I agree, but for me it was more about human involvement animals ||| I'm never surprised by what people do anymore. I bet people would read this still move the frogs to a urban pond. ||| That is a good question. Hopefully it is isolated to the UK. ||| I can not think of any, what about you? ||| Yeah, most people do not care that much about frogs. ||| nice chatting with you too! bye ||| As a man this makes me sick to see other men behave this way. ||| Your right, I do not think it will change either. ||| It is hard but when you hear somebody say grab them by the P, it is not hard to see that person actually doing that. ||| I agree that some woman make false allegations, but I do not think it is the majority. ||| It is the climate we live in today. Some of the claims you say, wait a minute that does not sound right, but we should still listen. ||| Yeah all of these issues need to be addressed in the proper manner. The world is so fast paced that most people do not have time to worry about issues that do not effect them. ||| We would be happier, but some people would be suffering in the dark. ||| I think bringing these issues to the light are helping some people. I think it is better than not thinking about them or hiding them. ||| Yes, because more men are thinking about their behavior. ||| Yes, some women are over reacting and some are flat out lying. What do you think? ||| I think there is a small group of women who think it is us vs them. I have three daughters, a mother, female coworkers and friends. I can empathize with them without thinking that I'm being judged as a man ||| Men should not take this personal unless they know they are guilty of that type of behavior ||| has anybody you know been a part of the me too movement? ||| I'm glad the movement has given women the courage to speak out. ||| Yes, one of my sisters was date raped at a party while she was in college and she is just know talking about it. I always wonder why women wait to say something, but I have never been in their shoes. ||| I agree with you. ||| Me too, no pun intended. Nice chatting with you. bye ||| Yes, , my grandmother and you? ||| Yeah. It is scary thinking that can happen to any of us when with get older. ||| It hurt me to see my grandmother lose her Independence ||| I kept my grandmother at home until she died, most people wanted me to put her in a nursing home but I could not do it. ||| I think you could do it. It is not easy, but it was a honor for me to be able to take care of my grandmother since she did so much for me in my life. ||| I understand that some people because of work or other reasons can not do it. ||| That is true, but the ones that you do get along with, hold them close because we all are on a limited timer. ||| sorry to hear about your uncle. getting together,that would depend on how close with live:) ||| Yeah, I try to stay in touch with my mother, both set of grandparents have passed, my father passed, and My oldest brother died last year at age of 41. ||| nice chatting with you too. bye ||| I agree, what do you think can be done to help? ||| I agree. It makes me think how good we have it. ||| Allow more people in and help the countries better themselves for people do not have to leave. ||| I think people in this world need my empathy for others. Nobody risks their life on a cheap boat because they want to steal from your country or take what you have. They just want a better life. ||| I agree, the main focus should be country improvements. ||| I hate to say it but we are part of the problem. ||| We took out Liyba's dictator and leave them without a government. ||| now they say it is a waste land. I know these problems do not have simple answers, but they do have answers. ||| I would hate to be on a nice modern ship in the ocean. It would be hard for me to get on a cheap boat with 300 people hanging on, but I guess I would not have a choice. ||| sadly a lot kids die on those boats too. ||| Do you have any other thoughts about the article? ||| you too bye ||| I remember that. I'm glad she broke barriers for women ||| Yeah, but looking back at her work with the Clinton makes me wonder. ||| How do you think that era will be looked at in history? ||| Yeah, with all this 92 crime bill talk, makes me look at the whole group differently. ||| Mainly Joe Biden voting for Clinton's 92 crime bill ||| Both ||| It could have been, my grandmother had Parkinson's and it locked up her arms and hands ||| As I get older I look at all people in high positions as being human and having the same flaws as everybody else. ||| Yes, most people look of for their best interest. I think congress both parties have sold out the American people. ||| Agreed. I think the two party system is for us the people to fight while the people at the top keep enjoying the soils ||| You too. bye ||| I think that they are senseless acts of violence, but I also do not think it is wise to made fun of people's religion. What do you think? ||| I would hate to find out one of my children were killed on social media. ||| Do you think the victim's father will find real peace? ||| Yeah, I would like to think I would not be hateful, but I have never been in his shoes. ||| No matter how a child dies, natural causes, accident or murder I do not think a parent ever gets over it. ||| That is a good question. Do you think these types of terrorist acts of mass shooting are just going to be the norm from here on out? ||| Do you see the immigrants as the threat or attacks on the immigrants by like in New Zealand ||| Sadly, I agree. I wish people can see that we are more alike than different. ||| I agree. I think most of thinking is pushed by the people at the top of the class system for the people at the bottom fight each other and do not look at them. ||| What do you think about the book that the father was making in honor of his daughter? ||| Nice chatting with you too! bye ||| That worry be horrible to be missing that many family members ||| I do not know how the world fixes this. ||| Sadly a lot of this is human nature. ||| me either, I hope it turns out okay for most of them. ||| You right you do not hear that name that much anymore. ||| Be force to push my son in a wheelchair until it breaks down. Those are some strong willed people. ||| it makes me think about what I complain about in my life most of the time is really nothing compared to what some people in the world are dealing with. ||| Do you think the USA needed/needs to be in the middle east? ||| Yeah, it is a real complex problem ||| That is very true. ||| I thought some of the European countries were taking in more immigrants? ||| That sucks, you have any more thoughts about the article? ||| nice chatting with you! bye ||| Man, I would hate to live in country with that much turmoil ||| I hate that fellow humans have to live through this. ||| Kind of, I think war and greed is human nature. ||| Yup and just like all animals we are territorial and out for our own basic survival ||| family comes first, but we need to think of ourselves as human family ||| I agree. I like the part of the article saying that the UN needs to address the root of the problem. Lets make this countries better so people do not need or want to leave. ||| Can you imagine leaving everything you own and going to a foreign place? ||| I agree, I do not think they have a choice. ||| Modern weapons make war so much more violent ||| Like you said, a small few can ruin it for a lot of people now days ||| I agree ||| you too. bye ||| I agree, I would hate to get that text message! ||| I wouldn't be around, I would had to take them on their word. ||| The stories about the leader gassing his own people. I do not know who is the bad guy in this story. ||| I can not afford $40 per kilogram of meat. ||| and what kind of meat? ||| These emphatic conversation hits have made me a lot grateful for my life. ||| a lot worse and there is so many people in the world going through so many bad things ||| It makes me mad when people say they could just stay in their own country. They just want a better life for their family. I do not have all the answers but I know we should have compassion for what they are going through ||| True, but look how worse we made Libya. It is a very complex problem. I just pray for everybody, us included ||| Yeah, I think we could afford to let a little more refugees in. ||| Nice chatting with you too! bye ||| I think it is very wrong and hurts the country and you? ||| Sadly, I do think is he is too different for most American presidents, but they were smart enough no to say it out loud. ||| There is a direct link between him and a lot of the mass shooting lately. ||| I wish I had an answer for hate, some people just are irrational ||| There are a lot of sad and lonely people looking for a group to join. I use they could just find one that is not hate focused. ||| Do you see the shooting slowing down? ||| Do you think the hate crimes/mass shooting are going to slow down? ||| I see them speeding up. ||| Do you think Trump will be reelected? ||| I agree. It was nice chatting with you! bye ||| I agree. I still feel sorry for the children and their families. ||| Working five months for 17 dollars, WOW! ||| Yeah, I'm surprised they haven't had a revolt. ||| It was a whole lot easier to have a revolution before guns. Now if you storm the castle your going to get shot. ||| We didn't have a revolution with modern guns. None of those guns could have sniped George off the boat at night with a scope. They are in a lose-lose situation ||| I agree I rather die fighting, but I hope I never have to make that choice. ||| America is not far off the have and the have nots, but our standard of not having nothing is a lot better than how some people are living in the world. ||| I wouldn't know how to tell my children that we are not eating today. ||| Yeah, there is no point of learning if you can not even feed yourself. ||| I bet if feels like a life time for the people that it is happening to. ||| Nice chatting with you too! bye ||| I\m good and you? The article is sad."" ||| Yeah, It makes me think about how much food my family waste. ||| My children are so picky of what they will eat or won't eat, but it is hard for them to understand how other children in the world are feeling. ||| Do you feel like it is their government's fault? ||| Yeah, I thought they had a lot of oil money in the country. ||| I agree. No child should go hungry. Like you said there are a lot of countries out there with a lot of hungry children. It is sad to think about. ||| Yeah, I heard some bad things about some of the charities doing relief aid. ||| Greed is a horrible thing. I couldn't sleep at night if I did that to children. ||| I sometimes wonder how far have we gotten away from loving life without having to have a lot of unnecessary things. ||| I agree. Technology is a good and bad thing. I think we are more detached now days. ||| Would you donate more if you knew 100 percent went to the people that needed it. I would. ||| Plus a lot of them have a lot of overhead. ||| I also thing is it better to set up systems to improve peoples life not  only just give them food or money. ||| I would like to travel to different countries like you said. See things first hand. ||| Do you have any other thoughts about the article? ||| You TOO! goodbye ||| It is sad. ||| I feel like the father is a real coward. ||| I feel that people should have the right to kill their self, it is their body and their life, but killing other people because your sad makes you a coward. ||| I agree. I know the mother and grandparents of those children are heart broken. ||| How close was it to you? ||| Was it a big story in the area? ||| I can not blame this just on mental illness he planned this out as most of people who do these kind of things do. ||| Do you have a funeral for the father? As one of his parents. he killed his own children, I do not know if I would even have his picture in my house. I know this had to be hard. ||| Personally would you? I say no for me. ||| It would just be too soon. I do not know how to help people when they get into that kind of shape. ||| Any more thoughts on the article? ||| nice chatting with you too! bye ||| I can understand this story from both sides, but I do not agree with the attack. ||| How do you feel about the animals being killed? ||| I don't like them being killed, but I understand. People use what is around them to make money or just killed them for protection from them. ||| We did the same thing in America with a lot of the animals that were here. I can not get mad at them. ||| I wonder how the horn market got so big in China? ||| I think a lot man would buy a product if they thought it would work to grow their manhood lol. ||| It is proven to be false, but they still believe it to be true in their culture ||| I think the rest of the world should pay if they to keep the animals safe, I believe that is the only way to really stop the poachers. What do you think? ||| The people who do not live in those countries should donate to that area so people do not have to kill the animals for profit. ||| I'm sorry I didn't say it clear. I was trying to say what you said. It would be a donation choice for the people who care about the animals. If you don't care then do not donate in my opinion. ||| You too. bye ||| I know war is war, but I still do not like this. ||| I think this makes more terrorist, what do you think? ||| It's okay, I know mistakes happen.  We killed more civilians than terrorist with that air strike ||| I would want to get some revenge if you killed someone in my family. ||| I think as a society as a whole we do not value others lives as much as we should. What do you think? |||  We made our point in the middle east, I think it is time to pull the troops out. ||| I wouldn't mind having troops stay if that is what the people of that country want.  After 9/11 I do not think there will be a major attack like that again, so the terrorist are not a threat to us. ||| Look at all the rules at the airport and the patriot act. They are on top of it in my opinion. , I still believe it may be a small scale attack but nothing large like 9/11. ||| Yeah I agree, I worry more about China and Russia when it comes to those kind of attacks. ||| Currently I'm more scare of an home grown mass shooter than a out of country terrorist. It makes me sick to have to worry about my kids at school. ||| I think the government watches the terrorist more and the kids slip through the cracks, but you could be right too. ||| I'm torn between protection from terrorist and restriction of my freedoms. How about you? ||| I calmed you down and you got me worried lol. ||| you too! bye ||| I think it is sad. ||| The world is a hard place to live ||| America is a good place ||| I agree ||| I guess not ||| never noticed. ||| a wall between the united states and Africa? ||| I guess ||| I think he already did. ||| I guess, it was nice chatting bye ||| Me too. I know they are very social. ||| I think they are smart. I have seen a documentary where they visited the bones of an elephant that died a year ago ||| I wonder why they just didn't take the animal instead of cite them that many times. ||| what do you think about zoos? ||| Me too, I think it is animal prison ||| At least the animals are not forced to preform ||| With technology zoo should be come outdated because you can learn about any animal at home. ||| I think sea world was the worst because killer whales are smart like elephants ||| do you think there should be laws about keeping animals in isolation? ||| I agree. I feel most people do not care either way. ||| Nice talking with you too! bye ||| it was very sad how they lost their lives ||| Yeah and so young ||| It makes you wonder why certain things happen ||| I know funeral cost are high and having three at once would be very costly ||| Yeah, I know the father of the children is very hurt ||| I know I wouldnt have any ||| yeah but you have to keep living to honor them ||| I lost my brother last year its been very hard but I have to keep living ||| yeah it was different from my dad and grandparents dying. I hope your sister gets herself together ||| It was very nice chatting with you! bye ||| I do not like the ban. What do you think? ||| I have four children too. Yeah if it effects other people than I support the ban, but if it only hurts smokers then that is on them. ||| I lumps things like this into the pile of the government telling people what to do with their bodies. ||| I can agree with you on playgrounds ||| I hate the smell of smoke and I think vaping is dumb but its not my body. ||| vaping is also starting to kill people by messing up their lungs faster then smoking. ||| I tend to lean on making everything legal, but that is because it personally effects me. ||| I have an autoimmune disease and have to take pain pills, over the past few years its been harder and harder to get because of other people abusing them that has nothing to do with me. ||| Yeah, it really sucks. That is why I would never tell another person what to do with their body. ||| I agree. If what you do effects other people then it should be banned. ||| You too! bye ||| What do you think about the article? ||| Yeah my mother smoked while I was growing up too. ||| I like them, but I also do not what people to be told what they can do with their body. ||| Yeah I agree with that. ||| Yeah anything that protects kids is good to me. ||| Do you think they should have smoking areas just for people who want to smoke? ||| I really think that they should decriminalize all drugs. ||| What people do with their own body is their business. Over the counter medicine can kill people too.  I think I'm sensitive to this because I have to take pain meds and I have to jump a million hoops ||| I think people should be made aware of the risk like vaping and make their own choice as long as they are not harming anybody but their self. ||| It was very nice chatting with you! bye ||| what do you think about the article? ||| Yeah, people care more about who is right than doing the right thing. ||| A lot people find it hard to get out of the way of their ego. ||| I also think a lot people lack empathy for people besides their self. ||| Yeah it sad but true ||| No I think it will remain the same what about you? ||| I think people only come together when something really bad happens and only for a limit time. ||| Then back to business as usually. ||| It sad because life is really so valuable, but people are treated like they are disposable ||| I agree, it was nice chatting! bye ||| No, how about you? ||| No, I never hypothetically lived as a soldier. I have taken a family member off of life support but I do not think of that as killing someone. ||| I totally agree with that. I think we put way less value on life than we should. ||| Protect my family is the only thing I can think of. ||| Yes, I was thinking they were lovers or something. The story really did not give a reason for the shooting. ||| How would you feel if your plane was delayed? would you have empathy for the person who died? ||| I would, but it made me think about how many lives that one shooting effected. ||| Yeah, the story is reported is most people get to move on. Like this mass shooting are a talking point for some, but to others its their new reality of living without a loved one. ||| As I get older some stories stick with me more. Like that little girl who was shot in texas. I have a daughter the same age and same name. ||| You too! bye ||| what do you think about the article? ||| Yeah it very sad. She wanted to be a doctor and now that will never happen. ||| I'm happy she wasn't killed ||| Yeah, even the bean bags kill people when fired. I do not know what they can use. ||| Yeah that could work. ||| I hope the conflict between the two countries come to an end ||| I would hate to live everyday in fear. ||| Yeah but it hard to move from what you know your entire life. ||| The money is the biggest factor. ||| people put money over lives ||| you too! bye ||| I do not think that anything will come from these war crime charges. ||| Airstrikes should be banned but it will never happen. ||| I feel sorry for the people who are just trying to live their life and get hit by an airstrike. ||| I'm guess there are a lot more stories like that one we will never hear. ||| Do you think the US should stop backing conflicts like this one? ||| I agree with you. It is confusing on who the real bad guys are. ||| To me, it feels like the UN has no real power. ||| Do you think we will have another major war in our life time? ||| I don't know. I think it really depends on when the world starts running out of oil. ||| The whole modern world depends on oil. I know I would be screwed if I could not drive my car or get food from the grocery store. ||| Yeah, but we need to start applying them now instead of later. ||| Once we do switch, I think there will be less wars in the middle east. ||| Yeah, but a lot of it about who controls the oil ||| Yeah, I always wonder how people would feel if I told them that God promised me their house and just move in and take it. ||| Do you have any other thoughts about the article? ||| You too! bye ||| I would hate to die by fire. ||| Yeah, what are the odds you go to get fuel and the tanker blows up. ||| Me too, and it sounds like they are going to find more bodies. ||| Yeah, stories like this make you be thankful for being alive. ||| No and You? ||| did anybody die? ||| that is a really good thing. ||| I would be a little upset, I would really be thankful for making it out alive. How about you? ||| I guess it depends on how much insurance coverage you have on your belongings, but as long as my family makes it out okay, I can buy everything I lost again. ||| you too bye ||| I would not want to die like that. ||| Made me think about people who don't have access to a gas station. ||| Yeah, I wonder what exactly happened. ||| That would be very freaky ||| It is probably very unregulated ||| They have to take that risk because they do not have any other option ||| that would be nice ||| sadly to say but I do not think anything will change. ||| Maybe they build some central gas stations. ||| you too bey ||| bye ||| I know, I think he is guilty. ||| I agree, but it seemed like he liked doing the same thing to different women. ||| I agree. I can't understand rapist and pedophiles ||| They say college campuses is where most rapes occur. ||| I agree, I think it is worst when athletes are involved because it is pushed under the table. ||| That is why I think he did it, too many coming forward. ||| I'm glad he can't do this to anymore women. ||| Me too, I would not wish that on anybody. ||| Sadly I do not think it will change. ||| It is in some of our nature to do these things. ||| I agree. The world is beautiful and scary at the same time. ||| I think people should only go to prison when they harm other people ||| I agree, it was talking chatting with you! bye ||| I'm surprised that the gap is not close to closing. How about you? ||| Yeah, to me it's simple equal pay for equal work. ||| That should be a simple law to pass ||| I think we think we are advanced but we are behind the times on a lot of things. ||| Agreed. I do think some jobs by their nature will have more men than women working them. Like firefighters, If a woman can pass the physical part of the job then she should have it. ||| I agree with that. ||| I agree, but this system was not built was everybody in mind so its going to take a while to change it. ||| As a man, I'm glad that you are doing what makes you happy and as a father of three girls I'm happy to see women push into uncharted territory ||| I know it pays good too. ||| I'm too much of a scary cat to touch electric. ||| Good lucky with your career and it was very nice chatting with you! bye. ||| I hate how we treat the environment ||| Yeah, but I know I'm part of the problem because I drive my car just like everybody else ||| I agree. I feel sorry for the generations that will have to clean this mess up. ||| I think we are starting to feel them now with the mega storms ||| I fear things are only going to get worst. ||| I agree. I think human greed is a huge problem. ||| There are plenty of charities out there to donate to like the WWF ||| Yes, but I mainly donate to human causes. ||| Or the turtles with straws in their noses. ||| That cools, I may do that also. ||| you too bye ||| I think climate change is going effect us all very soon. ||| Yeah the animals are suffering ||| I agree with that, but the animals do not care about politics ||| I agree, but who should be in charge of enforcing environmental rules? ||| Yeah I don't think they will work together. ||| Do you believe in climate change? ||| Yeah that is a real debate, I think it is man caused like the river issues in this story. ||| I agree that droughts are natural and they happen. This is a real complex issue. ||| Yeah, I think this debate will go on for a long time. ||| You too! bye ||| I wonder what discipline happened to the people who ordered the airstrike? ||| I agree, people do not respect life anymore. ||| what about being a person working for doctors without boarders and being killed trying to help. ||| I wonder who has the final say on an airstrike like that ||| I agree, we can not be worst than the people we are fights. ||| I did not like how they stopped the people from protesting ||| I think this makes more terrorist than it helps ||| I think it is time for us to leave some parts of the middle east alone. ||| I agree. I know that sometimes I feel like life is hard than reading stories like this really makes me think about how good I have it. ||| agreed. ||| Wow, I never thought about it like that. Do you remember the name of the podcast? ||| I think I only watched the youtube clips of that one, I must go back and listen to the whole thing. ||| Well It was great talking with you! bye ||| I agree, living under those conditions must be horrible. ||| I agree. I hope the war ends soon ||| To be honest it so confusing on who is the bad guys ||| Yeah and at one point they said the president of the country was bombing and gassing his own people. ||| Some countries are turning them away ||| me either, we just have to pray and hope for the best for them. ||| Yeah very complex and very sad. ||| That is nice, I think most people in this world are kind. ||| Some times the news of everything horrible is overwhelming but I feel it is important to hear the stories. ||| It was very nice chatting with you! bye ||| It is sad that these two countries can not reach an agreement. What do you think? ||| Yeah bombing are scary. ||| hopefully we will never find out. ||| I agree with that, but I did mutual damage keeps them from being used. ||| I do not like the fact in most countries they are controlled by one person. ||| I agree, I bet they have bombs and weapons that we don't even know about. ||| I worry about biological warfare ||| It may get worst as resources get tighter. ||| Do you think we will every have world peace? ||| I agree ||| you too! bye ||| Do you think it is more to the story of the shootout? ||| I agree with that. ||| I agree with that too. We should fix America first. ||| I would take that better than spending billions on a wall. ||| How much longer do you realistically think we will keep troops in the middle east? ||| lol you don't paint a bright future. ||| I agree with that, but it is only some much you can plan. ||| Your one of the few that have a farm and livestock 99.9 can not hunt or grow food. ||| Yeah, I learned from my grandmother how to plan my own crops. ||| Yeah she came from a hardworking generation ||| Yeah, but car companies are making it harder to even change a head light. ||| you too bye ||| I was surprised because I did not know the Jewish community felt like that and you? ||| That is a good question. ||| why not? ||| I think the holocaust put the Jewish community on edge. ||| The article also said some Jewish people voted for Trump. ||| Trump does not really distance himself from the alt right. ||| I disagree but we are all entitled to our opinions. ||| lol your entitled to think that. ||| you got me! ||| Yes, our Presidential election is being threaten because republicans are allowing it to be. ||| The republicans are blocking bills that now allow other countries to mess with our elections which threatens our democracy. ||| Your opinion, it was nice chatting with you. bye ||| I know that trains are safe to travel in, but this makes me pause. ||| I wouldn't want to be in either one. ||| If I had to pick one, it would definitely be the train crash. ||| Yes, any lost of life is bad. How about you? ||| One of my best friends died in a car accident. ||| DOA. She died along with her cousin and another friend. The other driver had a heart attack and ran the red light. ||| Thank you. I get why people are not emphatic for everything. We're overloaded with news. ||| True. I do wish people valued life more. ||| These articles have been making me do some soul searching. It was nice talking with you! bye. ||| I know what you mean. I know that I could do better on my part. ||| Yeah, I have a large family so it hard somethings to control waste. ||| I'm surprised that saving money they not motivate more people. ||| I have seen restaurants and stores give away food to the homeless instead of throwing it out. ||| I also try to compose some of my food waste. ||| Why can't you have one? ||| LOL. I could never live in a HOA. ||| I just wouldn't like people telling me what to do with my house. ||| So you can't even have a garden? ||| Me too. It was very nice chatting with you! bye ||| That was a short and strange article. What do you think? ||| It didn't give much context. ||| I agree with that. ||| I agree that it is a right to have a gun, but I also want background checks. ||| I think the tooth paste is already out of the tube as far as the guns that are already out there. ||| I don't think that we will ever lose guns. ||| I can see that happening. ||| I agree with that. ||| I don't really watch TV. ||| Yeah, too much overload. ||| I don't think there should be a ban on assault weapons. ||| It was nice chatting with you bye ||| Do you think people should kill themselves? ||| I agree, but I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body. ||| 100 percent agree with that. I have watched many family members suffer from cancer and lupus ||| Don't know, Canada is a head of the US on things like that and legal weed ||| I grow up in Michigan and remember the big fuss over doctor Kevorkian ||| He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. ||| He tried to push the law for something he thought was right. I don't blame him, but I do understand why it is a complex issue. ||| Have had it family members or friends that had a really prolonged illness? ||| I think when a person loses the joy of life and there is nothing but pain, it should be their choice. ||| Not encouraging it, but not making it that they have to use a gun or hang themselves ||| I do not fault you for your opinion. It is great to see how other people feel about different topics. ||| I can agree with that. It was very wonderful talking with you. Sorry about the typing brain farts, I have my daughter running around the room with an ear infection. bye ||| I agree. I still think the dad was wrong. ||| I feel that it is a dad's job to protect his children and never to harm them. I feel sorry for all the things going on in their house, but that is no excuse for what he did. ||| It has to be hard on the both families what happened. ||| Mark's family seemed really supportive. ||| Sorry to hear that. ||| I agree, I do not post good or bad things to social media. I like my life to be my life. ||| Now people kill themselves over what strangers say in the comments. ||| I would agree with that. I think children are exposed to a lot of concepts that at that age I had no clue about and was happy not having a clue about. ||| I agree. I found it heart breaking that the child got a heart transport and had to die by a gunshot. ||| I know this conversation is about empathy, I just can not put myself in the shoes of killing my family. ||| You too! bye ||| I think the people who mismanage the water should be punished. ||| I think it will be happening to a lot more America cities in the future. ||| I think a lot of cities were built with the older pipes and have not been updated, but I hope you're right. ||| I wonder what they are doing to mask the lead level. ||| Do you think the federal government should step in or leave it to states? ||| I agree with that. ||| It is a health crisis. ||| I hate that it effects children so badly. ||| I agree with that too. ||| Yeah, I hope as a county we update our highways and water pipes. ||| you too. bye ||| I think this issue is going to be a major problem for older cities, what do you think? ||| Yeah, I do not see a simple answer for this one. ||| Not companies but local and state governments. I think what they did to Flint should be a crime. ||| That makes me mad too. I like money too, but I wouldn't harm people to get it. ||| What is the timeline of getting the people of Kentucky water back? ||| That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country. ||| I can agree with that, outside money should have never have been allowed in government. ||| No, I have not seen it. I know they switch water supplies to save money. ||| Its hard not to get depressed thinking about all these issues because I see no end in sight. ||| You too! bye ||| It is hard to believe he had all those injuries, but we will never know. ||| I do not know if I would call it a tragedy, but it is sad when anybody dies. ||| I agree with that. I do not trust Russia because they are known for killing people who upset the government. ||| The thing that stood out most for me were the injures to other parts of the body. I could understand a head injury from a fall. ||| And it took so long for the investigation. ||| I agree with that. I wonder what made the family say heart attack so quickly. ||| That is more than likely true. ||| Yeah, I think all governments have their dirty secrets. ||| I think they got the same answers that we were given. ||| Do you have any other thoughts about the article? ||| I agree with that. ||| You too! bye ||| I think Russia did it ||| It sounds too weird to me ||| I can see him falling once ||| Maybe he fell and hurt himself? ||| Me too. They are not just in shock and will never really know what happened to him ||| That is true. I think he was murdered ||| No i have better balance when i am drinking ||| lol ||| I think somebody killed him ||| I don't know if he was nice or not. It was nice chatting with you! bye"
p036,"I think that this article is interesting. I don't really like what happened at all, but I feel mostly for the man who brought someone into his life. Then that person turned out to be involved in all this awful stuff - possibly even a murderer. It makes me sad to read. I also, of course, feel for the victim's family - what an awful way to die. ||| I am a pretty liberal person. I do believe that a democratic government can have an earnest concern for its people. But when I read stories like, I don't have to wonder too hard why people are afraid to give control to the government and large extra-governmental agencies. I feel deeply for the people who are sick and dying because a government says no. I am angry when vaccines are on hand and it takes jumping through loop holes to get approval to get the mobilized to patients in need. ||| I think it's really important to read this article. It goes to show how much a group of people are in need, and how dominance and facism can ruin a country for a long time from the inside out. Look at how the poor farmers lack security and cannot comfortably return to their crops. This is wrong all around, I hope it inspires some action. ||| The main idea about this article is that it focuses on a trend to reduce exposure to the ill effects of second smoke with regards to the public. The idea is to especially reduce the exposure to children. In this case, the focus is to reduce the smoke that happens in public parks and playgrounds. It is noted that similar laws have started to protect minors in vehicles. ||| A woman was arrested for assault, and during the arrest, the officer punches her in the face. The police department acknowledges this and it was captured on camera by several onlookers for the incident. Even the children witnessed the incident occur. It isn't clear if they even had a legitimate reason to arrest her.","Hi. How are you? ||| It makes me quite sad. I feel for these people without food available. ||| ABout the article or my sadness? ||| It seems to me from the article that the problem is less about getting the support in the area, and more about building a structure for self support. For instance, the farmers are unable to return to usable land because they are not secure there. ||| Well, the article legitimately points out that this support has to be mandated by government first. Getting food to the people is one action that is beneficial, but it isn't curbing the real problems. ||| So, I think the lesson here is that there really needs to be some counseling available for recovering governments - as crazy as that sounds - a not-for-profit that can help a sincere government regain control after something like the Boko Haram issue ||| Of course, it requires a lot sincerity on the part of the government. I think it is has a potential to be more effective than the mandated democracy via military action that the US tried in Iraq. ||| What gets me, though, as a parent, is the idea that the kids have to suffer for the follies of the adults. What do you think about all the suffering that comes from these horrible situations? How could that be managed? ||| If they are removed, how should it be done, and who should be put in their place? ||| Rome had a triumvirate. Three people in charge. Should a constitution allow a group of three to be installed when a single leadeer has failed? ||| That's nice. My timer is almost how. I think you need to say bye first if you are done with the conversation ||| bye ||| Yes indeed. It's very difficult, I think. Science makes it harder and easier. It's a double edged sword. ||| Yes, we speak so much without words. DO you have any final ideas? ||| I can do a few more rounds. What do you think the impact would be of a \partying\"" lifestyle for the jury?"" ||| You see these studies about rape cases and women \deserving\"" it. I was thinking more about the sympathy for the victim? Does it lessen that sentiment?"" ||| I agree with that, of course, but if there wasn't some general sentiment about it, there wouldn't be so many studies. I would hope something like that wouldn't sway anyone. ||| Comunale was the friend who died, but the surrogate father was Jeffry Rackover - a jeweler for celebrities like Melania Trump. ||| I am shocked that you meet someone at a gym and then go to lunch and then just let them take your last name. The kid was an expert grifter for sure. ||| And back to evidence - how can that attitude about life that is so clear and evident - be used in court these days? It seems so hard to trust anyone. ||| bye ||| I thought it was a pretty well written, but I wonder who is supposed to receive our empathy... the children or the smokers? ||| I agree with that. It is good to protect the kids. ||| As they are developing it is important to make sure they can develop safely. ||| What do you think of the law about preventing parents smoking in the car they own? ||| I agree with this too. Do you think it should extend to homes? ||| Well, maybe. But really just educating the politicians should be enough, right? They could then pass the law ||| WHy do you think, though, that there hasn't been the backlash for that really... ||| I mean, backlash for the car law. ||| Back to the kids, what about their current suffering - do you think the smoke is dramatically affecting them, or marginally? ||| bye ||| Good morning or afternoon. What was your initial thought on this article? ||| I agree. There are so many things this article brings up in me. I think the first is the access to vaccines, their use, and extrapolated to my situation as an American - the current anti-vaccine movement. This doctors had to go through hoops to get a vaccine for a dying population, and we take it so much for granted here that we have a significant group of people undermining the entire concept of vaccinations. ||| I think of my son, who is 8, and the possibility that he will be exposed to something, and it makes me frustrated. Our neighbors and anti-vaccine and they have a peer for my son. I don't think they understand that a vaccine works when the community uses it. When there are people who exempt themselves, it creates problems with the strategy to eradicate a disease. Then I think of these poor kids who are just trying to get through each day. Not only dealing with dirty water, but also no vaccine... ||| Absolutely. OK, that neighbor used to work in my office. She quit, then sued us for harrasment because we didn't let her work from home full time after having a baby. THEN she moved in next door and the first thing that happened was that her son got whooping cough - which is in the vaccines. The poor kid looked like death and was still going to school like it was nothing. That was the day I started driving my son to school every day - just in case. ||| I agree. I think I got over empathic and took over the conversation with my personal story haha. What else did you feel in the article? ||| Interesting because that was my other point I wanted to make. I am a generally liberal person. Certainly on a social level, but I also think a regulated and conscientious welfare system benefits the greater society... but I will be damned if reading a story like this doesn't make me at least understand the feelings of those people who want small government. ||| Absolutely. I fundamentally believe a truly democratic government would struggle supporting leaders that make these types of decisions in this article.... but then again, we got a Trump, so I don't know... ||| I saw that and then you see how the UN actually brought the epidemic. It's all such a mess. (This is turn 9 of 10 btw). ||| One more round (be sure to stay and answer the extra question). I do hope the best. As a parent I really do have a lot of feelings for what these communities are going through. ||| It's awful. We were on the marketplace for years and that was awful - $7k deductible! ANyway. It has been nice. Have a good day. bye ||| I do agree that the officer is incorrect here. I can't even figure out why they were detaining her in the first place. Did you see that part? Was it an expired or already served warrant? ||| Regardless, I have a friend who was arrested and the only charge was resisting arrest. How does that even work? How can your only charge be resisting arrest? What arrest were you resisting if there are no other charges? ||| Absolutely. It seems like they are wasting time. And then they punch her! ||| I had to track down the video, by the way. There is no dispute that she was legitimately punched in the face. It isn't like a maybe she was punched: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cop-punches-woman-video_n_582ddbd0e4b030997bbdd8c3 ||| And what makes me most upset is that her kids saw it. I really feel bad for the kids. Look, maybe mom isn't the best if she had a warrant at one point, but those poor kids seeing her get punched in the face. ||| I am sure of that. I guess since this study seems to be about empathy, what do we feel from the officer's perspective? ||| I mean, I understand it is a high stress job. So let's assume there was a clerical error and he sincerely believed there was a warrant for her. If she is denying that, then maybe he did feel she was resisting. I mean, I have trouble with the idea of punching her in the face, but we don't know what the warrant may have been. ||| I agree, and I think you said before that they need better training? ||| I always thought that was the case, but one friend of mine said cops are trained to kill witht heir guns, not to incapacitate - on purpose. This guy was a cop too, so I don't know. Maybe it isn't more training, but better training? ||| I think so. That is ten turns, by the way. ||| You too, bye"
p037,"Hello. I feel really terrible about the current coal mining situation in India. Many lives have been lost, properties destroyed, so many losses for the people of that country. It's really pathetic how the government has failed in their duty to protect the citizens. It's even more worrisome that they have also failed to compensate the victims. It's a pity  ||| Hello friend. It's with a heavy heart that I'm typing this. The story of what happened to those people is really pathetic and saddening. I feel really terrible about the event. Accidents of such nature are highly predictable and can be easily avoided but because of negligence and greed, operators won't properly maintain their machines. It's just sad ||| Hello friend. I heart is heavy and full of grief. What happened was really pathetic. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. It's so sad  ||| Hello friend. I'm ashamed to be called a parent after reading this article. How can a parent be so careless. It's shocking! They said the child's mother put him and a sibling to bed about an hour before he pushed the screen out and fell from the window, which had been left open, sounds like pure hogwash to me. ","Hello. The situation in India is really terrible ||| Apparently. The most worrisome part of the situation is the fact that they barely compensate the victims ||| Indeed. What do you think can be done on the part of the citizens in order to draw attention of the international communities? ||| In all honesty, I have no idea. ||| It's left for their government to decide ||| True. It's really pathetic ||| Nope. I doubt if the government will allow that. ||| The government in India is corrupt. They are involved in the illegal trade of ivory. They won't allow any external body to interfere with their business ||| I've read series of disturbing stories about their activities in the illegal trade of ivory ||| Yeah. It's all about the rupees ||| That's the reality. ||| That won't be a bad idea. How do \we\"" go about that"" ||| There have been several scam cases with GFM ||| That'll be great ||| goodbye ||| It's really saddening ||| Me too ||| I can't even imagine the trauma that their families will go through ||| I wonder what must have caused the malfunction of the ride ||| Apparently ||| And I think the company should pay some sort of compensation ||| In saner climes, such companies would be sued and shut down eventually ||| What do you think should be done to prevent future occurrence of such accident ||| Alright, but can you make a guess? ||| It will. Thanks for your time. ||| bye ||| Hello. What happened to those people is really pathetic ||| Indeed. I can only imagine the trauma the survivors will go through ||| I really don't like such places though because I fear things like that may happen ||| I understand. But nothing is impossible though ||| That's true. By the way, I think the company should be sued ||| As it stands, what happened probably was as a result of negligence. Accidents like these don't happen in Disneyland ||| Indeed ||| It's really saddening. I wouldn't want to be in such situation ||| Greed! That's why. It was nice chatting with  you. Do you have a nice day ||| bye ||| It's horrible what happened to him ||| In as much as what happened was an accident according to the police investigations, I think the parents should be blamed ||| Indeed ||| You should. I can't take my eyes off them ||| His mother holds most of the blame in this case ||| She was the one that put them to bed. She was supposed to check all windows properly before leaving the room ||| Either ways, what happened was really terrible. I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that ||| I hope so too. What would you advise parents that live in storey buildings? ||| Nice. I think that can curb future occurrence of such incident. It was nice chatting with you ||| bye"
p038,"Did you read this article? It's so heartbreaking I cannot take it. News stories don't affect me unless there is kids involved and the image of the little girls wandering around calling for her mum and the two children that lost their mother. It's horrific. It's also making me rethink rides like these because you know I love the kali river rapids at Disney which this sounds similar too. Maybe I should just stay away from rides all together. They just aren't safe. ||| Another shipwreck isn't this sad? A women lost her two month old baby. How heartbreaking. I can't even imagine what she must be feeling and going through. It is odd to me though that we live in a day where we have so much technology yet things like this can still happen. You'd think they would have ways to prevent this stuff now. ||| Hey check this out. Another big earthquake in New Zealand. I feel horrible for those that live their and the devastation they must be feeling. At least there wasn't a lot of deaths with this one. They have a long road ahead with repairs and rebuilding. It's so sad, my heart just goes out to them and what the people there are going through.  ||| This is sad. So many young women just used by the government. By men who are supposed to be for the people and in a leadership position to treat these women this way is absolutely disgusting. I hope something can be done for these woman. They need counseling. Medical help and lord only knows what all they need. But it should be provided by the government.  ||| this is so gross! Can you imagine living in a place where you can't drink the water because its basically mud? Those poor people. I hope that they get it fixed. It is nice they're getting compensated some though. $400 plus $80 for each dependent is pretty good, but of course I don't know how much they bring in normally so it could be bad,  ||| Airstrikes launched in Cairo killed over 40 people. Isn't that horrible? Why can't we learn to fight peacefully? Why do we have to resort to such violence? It seems like if we'd end the cycle it would stop. Maybe I'm wrong. But it just seems like we're on this merry go round and we need to get off it. Surely we can find a more peaceful way. ||| Wow read this....Angelia Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton wore vials of blood around each others necks! Isn't that weird? What are they vampires? I always thought she was so strange but that is just bizarre. I wonder what happened to her and Brad though. I never understand why he left Jennifer Anniston for that bizarre looking woman.   ||| Check this out. More celebrity news that no one even cares about. Do you even know who these people are? Am I totally out of touch? I have no idea who any of these people are. Should I care that they're getting divorced like 50% of America? Why do we put this in the spotlight when there are better things we can address? ||| Check this out....haze from the fires in Indonesia have killed over 100,000 people! This is horrific. It says that this is an annual thing which makes it even worse. How can they let this keep happening? I just don't get it so many deaths that are just in vain and lives and homes ruined. It's horrible but makes me so thankful I live where I do.","Isn't this heartbreaking? It makes me never want to go on another ride at an amusement park. ||| It is terrible. It doesn't even sound like its a thrill ride. It sounds like its just one of those water rides that you kinda float along and get wet but no massive drops or turns. I wouldn't have thought about getting hurt on a ride like that. ||| I don't know that makes me angry too. Because of someones incompetence people are devastated by the loss of someone close to them. ||| No kidding. Its not like there wasn't other rides to go on. just shut it down. Since its in Australia I wonder if they have to follow the same guidelines the theme parks here in the US have to follow? I'm pretty sure there's restrictions and guidelines. Or maybe thats just wishful thinking. lol ||| I don't know lol I'm not really familar with any theme parks other then Disney and I think they're kinda a class unto themselves. lol I'm not one for roller coasters and after reading this I'm not sure I want to go on any water rides now lol ||| True. We have our local fair going on right now and I took my daughter on the giant slide and going up the stairs that thing was so rickety I really don't think it was put together right. lol ||| No they probably can't which is too bad because they're such a fun thing to do once a year that doesn't require traveling far ||| I bet they are liable. I don't think that you would waive your rights unless you explicitly sign a waiver. But who knows maybe they make everyone sign a waiver. ||| Yeah 4 and I'm sure they will all sue for whatever they can. I think they can not only sue the park but probably whoever the person is that allowed the ride to continue to stay open after failing the safety checks ||| Same here. To be treated like that by people who are in a leadership position. Using their power to abuse women. It's horrifying ||| Probably not.They'll probably just get a slap on the wrist and go on their way ||| I agree. They just think they are above everyone and nothing bad can happen to them. It's so messed up. ||| No I'm not familiar with them at all. I guess I should pay more attention to whats going on in the world. ||| Same here. I couldn't do it. I'm not a violent person but I'm not sure what I would do if I were left alone with one of them. Death is too good for them. The state governor does sound like he wants to help though. Maybe he'll get something done? ||| I hope so. I feel like they need to do something for these women. Provide counseling and medical care free of charge. ||| Oh yeah absolutely. They will need extensive therepy and for the ones that got pregnant medical care will be necessary as well ||| I know. I have to hand it to the women that do it.  I don't think I could. After going thru all that I just don't know if I could raise a child on top of it in that situation. ||| It would be. To hand over your child to someone else has to be the most painful thing ever. I think I'd become very bitter ||| yeah. you always want better for your kid and I think giving them up to someone else would be the best option even though it hurts. So sad. My heart just breaks for these woman. ||| I agree. These people need so much more help then some other countries we're helping need. I'd much prefer to see my tax dollars going to help people like these woman ||| You don't! You never hear about things like this. People are so focused on the wrong things. Not that other countries don't need help and aid but I don't think some like you said Israel are as much in need as these people. ||| I agree. I wish we could choose. I mean I guess I could contribute to a charity that might send money there. But I also get iffy on charities and whether or not my money actually goes where its supposed to. ||| Yes now thats something I could get behind and support. These women need them more then anyone ||| same here its been great talking to you! ||| bye ||| Isn't this sad? I feel so terrible for everyone involved. Especially the woman who lost her two month old. ||| It was definitely a hard article to read. News stories don't get me much unless they're involving children and especially children dying. ||| I know. I just can't imagine the fear they were feeling. Like I know the adults and everyone had to be terrified my heart goes especially to the kids. ||| I'm always surprised when I hear about shipwrecks because I always think that the technology should be there o help prevent this stuff ||| I wonder if there wasn't any on board ||| If there wasnt I could see a lawsuit forming ||| I'm sure people will sue regardless it sounds like there was something wrong with the ship ||| I'm not sure. Maybe more regulations about ship safety and checking things more and making sure its up to code? ||| and lifejackets and boats if none were provided I can't remember if the article stated anything about that ||| I also feel for the ones who survived. They will need help with post traumatic stress as well ||| yeah I can't imagine what they will be feeling for years to come ||| I wouldn't be able too. It was great talking with you! bye ||| It is. I can't imagine having water that is so polluted like that. ||| I don't think I would. I wouldn't be able to think about anything but mud. I don't think I'd mind giving up the fish either. ||| At least they're getting some compensation ||| Thats what I was wondering. $400 a month plus $80 for each dependent sounds like a lot but I don't know the cost of living there ||| It sounds like the people down near the river were the most affected and getting the compensation and that sounds like a poor area to me. I could be wrong but that money could go a long way. ||| yeah at least they got some clean water. That must have been a blessing ||| I wonder if they have plenty to eat other then fish ||| ugh I'm thankful I've never had to encounter things lke this ||| yeah reading stuff like this makes me even more grateful to live here ||| yes I agree. Let's hope things improve ||| True! Well, its been great talking to you! have a good one. bye ||| 7 ||| I agree why cant we learn to get along peacefully? ||| I don't know we always have to get involved in everything. Thats part of the worlds problem. If we just stayed out maybe things wouldn't get so bad ||| Seriously. Its such a waste of our money. We're the ones paying for it yet we get no say ||| Do you think we'll ever just stay out of stuff? lol ||| its so sad so many had to lose their lives needlessly ||| oh my goodness. How awful for him. ||| Dang that is just horrible. I feel so bad for our military. I mean I'm so thankful and proud for what they do but I also feel so sorry for what they see and go through ||| They do. I'm glad they do because its not something I could ever do ||| thats okay! I don't know. I wish I had answers. I wish everyone would just get along ||| I agree. Our own country has messes of its own that we need to focus on cleaning up. ||| yes! we need to take care of healthcare, taxes, etc and just let everyone else take care of themselves ||| you too! Thank you! bye ||| This is so sad. I hate hearing about big earthquakes. ||| That's right! There was 2 decent sized ones. I'm glad there wasn't the destruction that New Zealand got ||| That's definitely the best thing! They have months of rebuilding ahead of them ||| I have no idea. All those homes lost. People must be heartbroken ||| Same here. But we do get tornados I'm not sure one is any better lol ||| I have some cousins in California but I don't talk to them. The rest of us are here in Tornado Central lol You? ||| Oh wow. That would terrify me. 40 seconds doesn't sound like a lot until you're in that kind of situation then it seems like forever ||| yeah I guess my knowledge mostly comes from sitcoms where they have to shrink down a huge event into a span of a couple seconds lol ||| I'm sure there's some fund or charity set up to donate to but I'm always so hesitant unless I know 100% of my money is going there ||| I have to do a lot of research before committing and it always seems like its the ones that are for reasons like this where they're like 50% for them and 50% for said charity. It so sad ||| Yeah I'd feel more like I was doing something to contribute ||| Yes the same to you! bye ||| I think its incredibly weird they wore vials of each others blood around their necks lol ||| She is really weird to me. I don't know what it is but I think she's just a tad creepy. ||| yes but maybe I'm just biased because I was very pro brad and jennifer lol ||| I just never understood why he'd leave her for Angelina, but what do I know lol I wonder if there's a chance Angelina and Billy Bob might reconcile now ||| probably not. I'm not sure whatever happened to him. Do you think Brad was really abusive towards their children like the article mentioned? ||| I think she might have just been trying to get him some bad publicity or something he always seemed like a good dad to me but who knows what goes on behind closed doors ||| Yeah he seems decent. I always liked him maybe they were just really toxic together. ||| I think anything is possible. I guess it depends on how their relationship was before and if they can forgive and move on. But I kinda see her going towards a younger man now. ||| Wonder what they reasoning for the vials of blood was? lol ||| you too! bye ||| I don't either. I don't get why this is even news ||| Wait Dakota is a guy? I thought he was that little girl that played in Uptown Girls with Brittany Murphy. whoops. I don't think so, I've never heard of them but then again I apparently am way off on who I thought any of these people were lol ||| hahaha who knows. Some reporter somewhere apparently thinks we care about this. I feel sorry for them. Like who wants their divorce splashed all over the news? ||| Same here. I don't know why you'd ever enjoy having your personal life and situations splashed on every tabloid. I can understand somewhat if you're a celeb. It comes with the job, but if her parents aren't famous except by her it seems terrible to publish their business ||| Maybe I guess I just can't wrap my head around the why. They aren't famous themselves (I don't think) unless they're trying to create some fame ||| I guess maybe it was amicable? Maybe one of those situations where they stay together till the kids are grown ||| that is true. neither one are probably really entitled to any of it lol ||| I would be too. I'd feel like I was embarrassing my kid too. ||| And Malculay Caulkin. I think his stepdad stole millions from all 8 of his kids ||| yeah no kidding. It's child labor and the kid doesn't even get anything out of it except a lifetime of emotional problems. Like every child star on Disney ||| No same here. I'm choosing a simple ordinary life for my kids maybe poorer but happier in the long run ||| I can't even imagine what that would do to a kid ||| you too bye ||| It makes me feel sad. So many people have died ||| It says its an annual problem. I wish there was something that could be done ||| I have no idea. What do you think? ||| Do you think anything can be done? ||| I'm not sure. ||| It really is. We get haze and smog from time to time and I've never thought about it being harmful except in the case of like car accidents ||| I'm sure it'll happen again and again with more needless deaths. But I cannot figure out what could possibly be done to prevent it ||| I wonder if there's anything set up to donate ||| No kidding those people need so much help its unreal ||| bye"
p039,PTSD is a tough problem to have I feel bad for those veterans that have to deal with it they must relive those awful memories over and over again in their mind it can not be easy to live with all the things that they had to go through in the theater of war they need to spend more on mental health for them. ||| that was many people that were killed in that paris attack these muslims are out of control killing people left and right Trump is right to stop immigration from those countries to america we need to protect ourselves from these savages killing people who are out celebrating and havina good time something needs to be done ||| We need more oil and more jobs where do these people have time to go and protest do they work or not I mean I have no time to go protest it is crazy to me that these people can stop the construction of a wonderful pipeline to bring more oil to us I love oil and I love when it is cheap and affordable ||| It is terrible that these kids have to starve but it was kind of funny that they were boiling grass I mean think about these africans they always have some sort of crisis even when they are rich in oil they still manage to ruin everything they are like monkeys they resemble apes they behave like animals ||| I feel very bad for the two little girls that were killed in the terrible accident. One minute you are happy and the next your dead. The parents must feel the worst in this situation I hope they will be able to move on wit their lives although I am sure it will be nearly impossible for them to move on ||| Can you believe this situation in Africa it seems like there is always something with these people they can not live in peace they really remind me of wild monkeys running around naked with their big lips who cares about these people Kenya should not allow more of these people in to their country they can not handle it ||| Cholera seems to effect poor countries more then rich ones which is why you should not care about this too much these countries need to start investing in their own ability to provide clean drinking water instead of looking for handouts they suffer from corruption which is hindering them from coming up with a way to fight the disease ||| I don't care about cholera we need to fix our own water problems here in the states before we try to help the rest of the world with their problems look at Flint Michigan we have people in America suffering without having a safe source of clean drinking water we need to help our own before we can help others. ||| It is sad to see the shooting of people and in the airport too it seems the world is going crazy there is all this violence everywhere you go you can't even go out any more without having to worry about these mass shootings and public shootings this is a very dangerous time we live in and we need to be safe ||| So their fighting over Kashmir again I really don't care about these people they are always fighting one another I think they fought 3 wars over the region already and now they have Nukes so I am sure they will kill each other off pretty soon which would be good for the planet we need less humans here. ||| Look at these Burmese killing muslims I can understand why they would do that though do you want all these terrorists running around your country creating mischief in the land we need to start deporting our muslim population before they start a revoulution in this country its important we support BUrma ||| It was a shame that there was a fire but at least they did not die. It could have been much worse the firefighters did a good job in preventing the loss of life. It was very good that there wasn't more serious injuries this could have been much worse but thank god there was someone watching out for these people ||| It is sad that all these kids are overdosing on these drugs it seems like the parents are too dozed out on these pills to pay attention and the part about how heroin overdoses are happening to these kids really shows the state of the country and the use of drugs and how prevalent it has become among people.  ||| can you believe that they would throw a flamingo on the ground like that I can't believe the things that people will do and flamingos are such majestic birds and such vibrant colors I would be sad to see such a beautiful bird dying I think they should lock that person up for a long period of time to teach a lesson ||| It is terrible what is happening to the rivers and the animals I think global warming could be playing a role in the matter the animals are being effected and soon humans will feel the effects of global warming hopefully they get some rain soon and they can save these poor animals facing all this hardships ||| These doctors are working hard to help these people I suppose it is important that they do this work but at the same time maybe they should stay home and focus on their own people instead of going around and solving everyone elses problems it seems like these people need to know what the real world is like ||| Can you believe there is still leprosy around this day and age? I did not know that squirrels could even carry the disease from now on I will be more careful around them since they can carry such a serious disease I thought that leprosy only existed during the time of Jesus I am surprised that it is still around.  ||| wow I did not know that squirrels could carry such a serious disease it is kind of scary but also it is really interesting to see how adaptable and amazing nature can be I am glad that they have not spread the disease to humans but I feel like it is inevitable that some disease will attack humans in the future ||| Too bad what happened to these Syrians but honestly I don't really care let them all burn up one less muslim to worry about I think they should bomb the whole country and turn it to dust but I guess we can't just go around killing millions of people unless we drop a nuke on them like the Japanese because that was justified ||| It is a shame that they are going through such hardships I feel bad about the little baby that died and bombs falling on them but that is part of life growing up in an uncivilized world where savages run rampant if they could just get rid of the people and start over maybe just move all the savages out. ||| who cares about a dead kitten do you know how many little human kids are being abused and sold into sex slavery there are so many things that we have to solve about humans before we go around saving kittens and dogs I think it is a shame that these people are wasting time saving stupid animals spend time on people ||| Its a shame what happened to that pitcher after all the struggles he had to get to the position he was in he died in a terrible boating accident it seems that fate does not care who you are when it is your time to die you will die in the exact time and place that you were meant to die I guess its life. ||| Its amazing how people facing the toughest hardships can turn their life around and really make something of yourself if you put your mind to it. His brother converted to Islam that probably helps people in Jail when you need some structure to really get yourself in a place where you can learn about yourself ||| I feel bad for the animals in the zoo they should not be allowed to keep animals like that when people are starving in the streets I also see how we are to blame for the starvation with our sanctions we are basically the big bully in the world telling people to do what we want or else we will cut you off ||| Its sad to see her have cancer but I really don't care I hate how celebrities feel like we need to care about them it makes me sick millions of people die and we never know their names why don't we celebrate these people who are the normal people of the world we need to care about each other instead ||| I do not care for these muslim refugees trying to come into these countries they need to be deported back to their own countries and try to fix their own problems they are a disease upon the world and they spread their backward way of thinking trying to make no go zones inside the western world they are scum ||| I think it was good that they killed that kids horse what was he doing there any way his parents should get locked up for putting him at risk like that. I think we need more oil and I don't care how we get it. I hope we build more pipelines all over this country. I don't need to be paying more for my gas. ||| That was a sad story wow that was terrible what happened to that poor dog but then again I hate dogs so I'm glad its one less dog left on this planet if it were up to me I would shoot all the stupid ugly dogs that are out there I can not believe people keep them as pets they should eat them like they do in china ||| I hope they kick those migrants out.

p040,I think it is very sad. I think many people are turning to suicide because they are desperate. They are depressed and can't take it anymore. It is an awful place to be in. The family was well known but that does not keep them safe from the depression or despair that can hit anyone at any time. You should look out for one another. It is a very tough world out there. It is very easy to slip into a depression. This did not have to happen to him.,Hi ||| I think he was very depressed ||| I guess we will never know ||| yes me too ||| that will be forever in their heads ||| yes for sure ||| yes you think someone would have stopped him ||| yes for example look at that woman that keeps sneaking on planes how does she keep doing it ||| yes for sure ||| yes they need to be up to par ||| it was great chatting with you also ||| bye
p041,"The article is kind of tragic and hits close to home as I am the son of Haitian immigrants. Haiti has a lot of problems that only become exaggerated during natural disasters. I think what the Haitian people really need from the international community is help developing infrastructure so they can address these issues themselves. Foreign aid only acts as a band aid. ||| It is some what saddening that suicide rates among young children have increased, but not surprising. I believe there is a correlation with the increased prevalence of social media and the rise in this kind of phenomena. Social media use is correlated with mental illnesses such as depression, which in turn are linked to suicides.  ||| I think it is a testimony to the inefficacy of the Nigerian state that sex crimes should be so pervasive in the refugee camps. The government should have done a much better job of screening the people who would be placed in these critical positions of authority. The guards should been majority if not exclusively female. ||| It is incredibly alarming that slavery is still being perpetuated in certain parts of the world. I am particularly disturbed by the fact that the parents willingly sent their children to this tailor. How disturbing. These young girls were robbed of their innocence and their parents did not sufficiently protect them. ||| The article lacks clarity on whether Isbindi was a child or a rhino. I am more than a little confused. I have neutral feelings toward the story as it was presented. Any loss of life is tragic, but more so when it is an innocent and defenseless child. I was also quite curious as what exactly was the cause of death. ||| I found it interesting that there were Saudi women for and against the guardianship program. I think in a broader sense this will only inflame tensions between Saudi's and the west as the more traditional Saudi's will undoubtedly blame western culture for these ideas. The fear of encroachment of western values into their culture has been a fear of Saudi Arabia since the kingdom's inception. ||| It is quite disturbing that the number of teen suicides in Russia is so high. It is far less surprising that there is a direct link between the increase in suicides and the Russian social media site VKontakte. I think there is a causal link between teen suicides in the US and the growing popularity of similar sites. ||| I have very neutral feelings toward the article. I do not condone suicide in any form, but I also respect the right of a person to choose to end their life.  I do not feel grieved or bothered by Mrs. Brampton's passing. I hope she did not suffer, but it is clear that she did not want to live an that was her choice to make.  ||| I am not surprised that the nations of Africa are having difficulty agreeing on conservation efforts for elephants. There is much disharmony politically between them. Africa is home to a number of endangered and threatened animals. I think the global community has to be involved in these conservation efforts. ||| It is sad that the father and son died during their hike. At least they were both with someone they loved. I would not want to be a father who had to witness my own son die. I was also curious as to what exactly happened to the helicopter that was tasked with helping them. I wonder what kind of failure it experienced. ||| I did not find the article to be particularly disturbing or alarming. I was not surprised by the fact that pollution adversely affected the health of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer. The health of their respiratory is already compromised and it makes perfect sense that pollution would act as an irritant and cause greater concern for their health. ||| It is difficult to convey my thoughts and feelings regarding the article as it was not very detailed. It is alarming that polar bears are facing threats to their habitats. I think conservation efforts as a whole should be increased worldwide. Human beings are causing irreparable harm to the ecosystems of this planet and it has to stop.  ||| I found the number of adolescent deaths in Russia alarming, but not surprising. Young adult suicide rates here in the US have also been increasing since 2004. The fact that the suicides in Russia have been directly linked to social media is very telling. The rise of adolescent suicide here in the US directly parallels the rise of social media. ||| This is incredibly alarming. Humanity is doing irreparable harm to the planet and many of its delicate ecosystems. We can not continue to allow our plastic pollution to threaten the lives and habitats of birds and other marine life. We need greater conservation efforts and sever consequences for those who do not abide by them.","Do you think the people of Haiti will ever recover from the effects of these recent natural disasters? ||| Yes it is. The people there need a lot of help. What do you think are some of the best ways to get them the help they need ||| I am inclined to disagree. More money is only a temporary solution. I think they need lasting change ||| Yes corruption is a huge problem. I think the NGO's and the UN should focus more on teaching the Haitian people to help themselves and develop the country ||| I don't think the US wants a ''better'' government. They want a government they can control or influence. Corruption helps with that agenda ||| Do you think the United States has a vested interest in a developed and autonomous Haiti? I don't think so ||| Yes. I think that is the only way to get lasting long term and meaningful change. We have to help them help themselves ||| I disagree. With all the corruption it would just be money wasted. We should control the funds and focus more on sending people and material ||| Some other questions would be how much money and how long would we have to be involved? ||| I think 10 years is a good figure. But it seems like any problems Haiti has are only made worse by natural disasters. And no one can stop those ||| That might take a lot longer than 10 years. It might be a good idea if the UN established permanent or semi permanent facilitiesc ||| True, but who would want to go there long term? I know I wouldn't. It's so far away and so different ||| The compensation would have to be high to motivate the right people ||| True but would it be enough to keep them from their friends and family for long durations? ||| Yes I can see that. It has been nice chatting. We have to bring our conversation to a conclusion ||| goodbye ||| I was not really bothered, suicides are common ||| No not everyday but people do it and that is their choice ||| I see what you mean but don't you think that being sad is just a waste of time? ||| Easy now. I did not mean it as a personal attack. It just doesn't make sense to me to be sad for someone who makes a conscious choice to end their own life. It's their choice ||| Let me be clear, I would rather no one commit suicide. How do we know that they were beloved? They could have despised each other ||| A fair point. When you think about it suicide is the easy way out. It is a bit cowardly. Choosing to continue living requires real courage ||| We can agree on that. Do you know anyone personally who committed suicide? ||| I got that impression from your responses. Do you think the loved ones deserve treatment or should preventative measures be the answer to suicide? ||| Hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, or even depriving someone of their freedom temporarily to ensure they do not take their life ||| What do you think causes suicide? Most animals have such a strong will to live. What causes people to abandon or ignore that innate drive? ||| I am not sure myself. Most animals also do not have complex social structures and constructs like humans. I am sure that with those stark differences it would be good place to start the investigation. ||| I was wondering that myself. I think the best animals to study would be primates. I know chimpanzees can suffer from depression but I am not sure whether or not they commit suicide ||| True, but they also don't do a lot of things we do and I am not sure whether or not suicide is in the Do or Don't category. ||| Refusing food and sexual gratification are some of the things chimpanzees do when they are depressed. Similar symptoms in humans. If they were to commit suicide how do you think they would go about doing it? ||| Yes very interesting. I hope you have a good day as well. ||| bye ||| Hello, I thought it was very interesting but not really surprising ||| I thought it was interesting that some African nations actually want to lift the ban on ivory trading and argued that it would help elephant populations. lol ||| It may have to do with competition from mammoth ivory in Russia ||| Do you think it makes sense to have some elephants listed as appendix 1 animals and others not? ||| As it was stated in the article elephants don't have passports. It doesn't make sense for them to have different protections on different sides of a border. This would just create ''arbitrage'' opportunities that poachers would no doubt exploit ||| I wonder if Africa's development and modernization are correlated with poaching at all. I would like to believe this would decrease poaching as an industry ||| What makes you say that? ||| Kenya just recently instituted the death penalty for poachers. What do you think would be some good ways to discourage poaching? ||| I don't know much myself. I don't support the death penalty generally and in this case I don't see how it would help. Poachers will move further south and increase their activities in other parts of the continent. I think on balance this will just lead to more poaching ||| I think that is the biggest problem that conservation efforts in Africa face. Enforcement. If the African nations even agree on what measures to take, they almost never enforce them rigorously. ||| Do you think the international community has a duty to intervene at this point? ||| I don't think the African nations can take the helm. The more time they spend disagreeing the more threatened elephant populations become. I really think the UN should be more actively involved. Perhaps not with legislation, but definitely with enforcement. ||| I hope so. We can not continue to do nothing as a global society. More and more animals are going extinct. I just read an article that stated that the last known female Yangtze Turtle in the wild died recently. ||| Yes that is true, but more and more are going extinct because of human activities. That has to change ||| I hope you enjoy your day as well. bye ||| I was thinking the same thing. Maybe the weather was a factor ||| Well it was in California, so I am not so sure about that ||| I was also wondering if there was any foul play ||| There could have been someone that has not yet been discovered who was involved somehow ||| I would not rule it out. It just seems too strange to me that two perfectly sensible people just fell off a cliff ||| We are just speculating. I wish there were more details. I was also curious about what failure the helicopter experienced ||| It seemed like negligence to me. I don't think the helicopter was well maintained ||| OK. Also what kind of safety measures were implemented near the cliff? Did the trail lead directly to it? ||| I would agree about the fencing. Yes I wonder how the mother is coping and/or any siblings. ||| They might be thinking about suing the county or state. ||| Both are equally valid in my opinion. I was also wondering if any other people have fallen off that particular cliff ||| Also how steep was the cliff? How far did they fall? ||| That is a great question. That's one of the reasons I suspect foul play. The last person with victim(s) is usually the first suspect ||| It could have been another hiker. The call would have to have been made shortly after the fall since the rescue helicopter was dispatched ||| There should be plenty of evidence. I doubt they went off that cliff willingly ||| goodbye ||| It is quite alarming that suicides among young children have increased, but not at all surprising ||| Why do you worry about your cousins? What makes you think they may be at risk for suicide? ||| That can be troubling. Do you think their behavior is out of the ordinary for children their age? ||| That can be a factor. I believe there is a direct correlation between social media and suicide in general ||| I agree. Increased social media use is correlated with many negatives, depression is one of them. Depression and suicide are also linked ||| The date listed in the article is very telling. The suicide rates began to increase in 2007. This is around the time that social media prevalence increases as well ||| I am not sure. But something has to be done to address the negative impact that social media has on society ||| No I do not know anyone who has committed suicide? Do you? ||| Is your friend active on social media websites? ||| Using the sites for browsing qualifies as activity. I think social media websites should be required to provide online counseling for their users. I think this would help ameliorate some of the problems ||| It was nice talking with you too. Do you have any ideas on how to improve the impact of social media on suicides? ||| Thats a good idea! Maybe if there were someway to monitor the emotional state of the user and limit the activity based on that. What do you think? ||| goodbye ||| It is a shame that these survivors were abused by the people they sought refuge from ||| What do yo mean? ||| So you believe Nigeria is lawless because of Islam? ||| I see. I saw it as more of an indication of corruption and dereliction. I hope they have provided adequate counseling services for the victims ||| I don't know either. The guards at these camps should have been women ||| The camps were not exclusively for women. But they should have been segregated for women and children ||| Nigeria is relatively wealthy compared to its neighbors on the continent. It is one of the wealthiest African nations. Their government has issues with corruption ||| Nigeria has wealth stemming from the countries oil reserves. It is rich in a particular type of crude oil that has fewer impurities. But the country is corrupt and the wealth is not evenly distributed, which can lead to many other social problems ||| I have neutral feelings toward the article overall ||| I was not really surprised by the findings and the study was not detailed ||| No, but it makes sense that pollutants could act as an irritant and adversely affect those with preexisting lung conditions. How do you feel about the article? ||| Why do you feel sad for them? ||| Do you know anyone who has or has had cancer? ||| Do you feel some kind of connection with people suffering from cancer? ||| How would it make you feel if you discovered that some these patients were offended by your pity? ||| How would you change your ways? ||| Do you think the study was conclusive? ||| How do you think the study could be improved? ||| Do you have any particular suggestions regarding the research methodology? What would be a good way to investigate the survival rates of lung cancer patients exposed to polution? ||| That sounds like a start. Are you interested in this particular kind of research? ||| Why not now? If you don't mind my asking ||| What do you think about the people dying in India from air pollution? ||| How would you feel if you found out there wasn't anything that could be done? ||| bye ||| I was thinking the same thing. Based on the information given what do you think? ||| Yes I did as well. Also the last known female Yangtze turtle just died. Humanity has to do better ||| I am inclined to agree. Partially. I understand that greed is very powerful, but it is the lowest of all human emotions. I think people can rise above it someday. I hope it's not too late when we do ||| I agree. I was also wondering how many polar bears were affected. What steps do you think should be taken? ||| I doubt anyone has a truly legitimate reason for being that close to polar bear habitats. How do you think conservation efforts as a whole can be improved? ||| What makes you think that people don't seem to care? ||| I think humanity needs to do much more. I agree about the media not focusing on these issues. I think government needs to do much more to protect endangered animals and hold people accountable. Do you think the issue regarding the polar bears in the article may be related to climate change? ||| Maybe the polar bears are coming into contact with humans more because their habitat is melting away. The politicians will talk about whatever they think people want to hear. What do you think is a good way to get people to care more about conservation issues? ||| That is certainly a possibility. But too much information is better than too little. What might be some ways to get people more actively involved once awareness has been raised? ||| I am sure all these things would be helpful, but I am not convinced it would be enough. I would propose a more hands on approach by taking people to actively patrol conservation zones are at least to a zoo or similar area so they can have some face to face time with these animals. What do you think> ||| With sufficient motivation there is nothing stopping what someone will do. The question is how do we get people sufficiently motivated? I would really miss the polar bears when they are all gone ||| Wow. Why wouldn't you be willing to help? ||| So you feel overwhelmed? ||| What could be some other realistic ways for you to get involved beside donating money? ||| There has to be some interesting way you can make a contribution outside of giving a donation ||| I mentioned them already. I would rather not suggest anything punitive like fines or taxes ||| I am trying to think of something like earth day where some people plant trees. That is a great conservationist effort ||| bye ||| How disturbing that these young girls were enslaved, how does this article make you feel? ||| They were robbed of their innocence. When I think about how their parents sent them to this tailor I get angry. How could you do that as parents? ||| Being poor is no excuse in my opinion. What's even worse is that they were physically abused ||| Of course they will be. What a shame that the authorities only intervened after international headlines popped up ||| probably thousands. the question is how does an organization like the UN step in to stop these atrocities? ||| I was wondering how the UN might put pressure on the Burmese government to correct this. Sanctions perhaps? Or maybe an intervention force? ||| How effective would they be? How quickly would sanctions work? ||| That seems like a great place to start. So many adults were complicit. It must be a cultural issue there to devalue a child's life ||| Education I suppose. I think the practice is considered tolerable because the victims are poor. It's hard to teach someone that all human beings are equal when they live so differently ||| Lol how can someone be educated to love their own children more than they love money. This is why I think the international community has do more to prevent this kind of exploitation of young innocent children ||| Some kind of peace keeping force to patrol the areas most likely to be affected by this kind of human trafficking? what do you think? ||| They would if there were sufficiently many members of the international community behind the idea. Without some serious intervention and consequences this ugly practice will continue, I mean just look at our own history. It took the Civil War to end slavery, without it who knows how long slavery would have lasted ||| That sounds like a plan. Between sanctions and a peacekeeping force they would have no choice but to agree. But it can't be that simple because the human trafficking is ongoing. What have we overlooked in this situation? ||| Or maybe the international community are not all on board. If that's true I wonder why that might be? ||| You may very well be right. Greed strikes again ||| It has been an interesting conversation, goodbye ||| How did you feel after reading the story? ||| I was confused about that since an orphanage was mentioned. I was not sure whether it was a child or a rhino ||| That does not sound like much of a sanctuary. Why would rhinos need power anyway? ||| What kind of treatment do you think they need? ||| What do you think the cause of death was? ||| I was thinking disease as well. Most infant animals die from disease if not predation. How old do you think the rhino was? ||| What do you think a baby rhino smells like? ||| No I have never seen one in person. It pains me to think of all the poaching they are at risk for ||| I did not know that. I think that is what they are mainly poached for. If they do grow it back, why not farm them instead? ||| Yes Asia is the main market, which is why the horns are so valuable. I am sure scientist have established that there are no benefits from rhino horns but people still believe in fairy tales.... and rhinos still get poached ||| I agree hopefully the internet can help educate and create awareness. I am still wondering how a rhino can become orphaned? What do you think? ||| No I don't, but I don't expect that they do. In most mammals the females exclusively raise the young. I wonder how they orphans are discovered initially? ||| That makes sense. How long do you think a baby rhino can last in the wild without its mother? ||| Yeah I was wondering how long they would be able to avoid predators. Without their mothers they are pretty much defenseless. I would really like to see one in person they seem like majestic creatures. Do they have good temperaments?? ||| They seem aggressive to me, why else would they have that huge horn? ||| goodbye ||| Do you think the campaign to end the guardianship system in Saudi Arabia will be successful? ||| I don't think we should criticize their culture after viewing it through a lens of our own. I also don't believe women are treated more in a cherubic sensed as property. I would say they are regarding more ||| What do you think about the women who support guardianship? What is your impression of them? ||| I agree that is their choice. I sincerely hope some compromise can be reached because it does appear that there are some women who are dissatisfied. I worry about how this movement will affect relations between Saudis and westerners ||| Do you know much about Saudi Arabia's history? ||| Well the short version is this: the first king of Saudi Arabia united the peninsula by warring with some tribes and allying with others. Classic Game of Thrones stuff. However in order to win his campaign he decided to ally himself with the Wahhabis. They were known for being particular good soldiers, but there was one catch: they are extremely orthodox and they made him promise that the new kingdom would follow their religious ideology. The new king began trading oil with the west and opened Saudi Arabia to westerners culturally and economically. The Wahhabis did not like this and they have been expressing their frustration about it in many ways for years, sometimes violently. ||| Yes, the king made a promise he could not keep and the rest is history. Western culture has been slowly becoming more popular through trade, media, and now the internet. The traditionalist have been getting angrier and angrier about it over the years and I am concerned that this new movement will enflame these tensions. If that happens I don't think the west will be insulated from it. ||| Yeah they might read different books but they are pretty much the same, but the traditionalist in Saudi Arabia have a lot more money and sometimes fund extremism. ||| Maybe you are right. I hope that the Saudis can find some compromise, but if our culture is causing tensions between them maybe we should just back off. I would like whatever outcome allows us both to coexist peacefully. What do you think? ||| Yea I agree. Do you think guardianship will ever change or be abolished? ||| It seems like the opposition to it has been peaceful so far. Let's see how long that lasts. I found it interesting that the article mentioned there were women who support guardianship. I was hoping to hear more about them and why the support it ||| Why do you think some Saudi women might be in favor of guardianship? ||| Good points. I was also curious what some of the Saudi men had to say about the issue but the article did not mention it ||| What do you think they might say about it? ||| Yes I am sure there is much debate. The article mentioned they were also discussing changing some aspects of guardianship. What changes do you think could be made that would ameliorate the concerns of some Saudi women? ||| That might be a good place to start. This has been a great conversation. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye ||| I was alarmed by some of the high suicide rates in Russian adolescents. I had no idea it was  so high and prevalent. ||| Were you aware that adolescent suicide rates are also on the rise here in the US? ||| I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia can be directly linked to social media groups. The rise of adolescent suicide here in the US directly parallels the growth and popularity of social media ||| Why do you think Russian teens are embracing this online suicide culture? ||| It could be that. Do you think socioeconomic factors play a role? ||| Which specific factors were you thinking of? ||| I think that can play a role, but Russia has the 3rd highest rate of adolescent suicide, 20%. Furthermore 45% of Russian teenage girls reported thoughts of suicide and 27% of teenage boys did the same. I think there is much more going on ||| Yea disturbingly large. I think social media paints a portrait of a lifestyle that is beyond the reach of many young Russians. Coupled with poor economic prospects many of them fall into despair, apathy, and hopeless thoughts. ||| I think one solution would be to require social media websites to offer online counseling services to their users, particularly to those who are at risk ||| What suggestions do you have? ||| I agree, but the trouble is that mental illness is not always easy to spot and sometimes these people are difficult to treat because of that ||| Maybe you're right. I also think we should discourage young people from idolizing vapid ''public figures'' and ''influencers'' they encounter on social media. Most of those people do not add value to society ||| I am wondering why we are not having a similar debate about these issues here in the US ||| What makes you say that? ||| Don't you think that teen suicide is important enough to focus on? ||| That breaks my heart. It has been interesting chatting with you today. bye ||| What do you think about the growing suicide rates among Russian teens? ||| Would it surprise you to discover that a similar trend is occurring among US teens? The figures are not nearly as high, but there has also been a substantial increase suicides among US teens. ||| Do you know anyone who has committed suicide? ||| I am sorry to hear that. I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia were directly linked to social media ||| The growth in suicides among US teens has paralleled the growing popularity of social media sites, but the two have never been directly linked like the Russian cases. I think awareness should be raised. ||| What are some ways you think this situation can be ameliorated, both here in the US and in countries like Russia? ||| I think social media companies should be required to offer counseling services to their users, particularly those who are at risk. ||| I agree. We should also give children real role models so they do not wind up emulating the vapid ''public figures'' or ''influencers'' they encounter on social media. ||| What do you think were some of the causes of the increased suicide rates among Russian teens? ||| Do you think there could be more complex socioeconomic factors? ||| You are probably right. It has been very interesting discussing the article with you. Enjoy your day, goodbye ||| I was alarmed to learn that they are eating the plastic, but I can not say I was surprised that it is having such a damaging effect on their ecosystem ||| If I remember correctly is was algae coating the plastic that emit the DMS. In any case we have to increase conservation efforts because we are poisoning this planet ||| I have seen so many novel ideas to accomplish this, but there does not seem to be any real political will to implement them sadly ||| I understand it may be a daunting task, but wouldn't it be more manageable if retrieval efforts are concentrated around the shoreline? We know the waste begins its journey on land ||| I read about a small town that did something pretty simple but effective and it reduced their run off waste by about 90% ||| Yes we don't have the right to adversely effect other species. You wouldn't believe me how simple this solution was ||| They just put a large fine mesh net on the outlet of their storm drain so the plastic didn't runoff into the local river. The pictures I saw showed it full of plastic they collected and prevented from reaching the ocean! Amazing, simple, and effective! ||| What do you think are some ways we can help reduce plastic waste in the ocean? ||| I agree that it will take serious life style changes, but I only see the demand for plastic products increasing in the future ||| You are very welcome. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye"
p042,"This is a very serious situation as it affects both the wildlife and forest situation in Indonesia. It affects the population of the endangered Orangutan species. The government must do everything to protect the trees, provide rangers to protect the life of the Orangutans. Provisions should be made to reduce wildfire. ",
p043,"I didn't know coal mining had such adverse effects on the surrounding environment. It has basically ruined the lives of the people who live nearby these mines. And the animal populations too, imagine a heard of elephants not able to sustain themselves with the food available and needing to invade human territory...They must really be in a desperate situation.  ||| It's so sad that our disregard for the environment since the Industrial Age is having such an effect on the entire planet. The ice melting too soon is going to have such an effect on polar bears and pretty much every animal. I'm not sure what we can possibly do to prevent polar bears from dying out because of a lack of food. They need that ice to hurt seals and without it, they are restricted to what they can hunt on land.  ||| I wasn't bullied much as a child but I can really sympathize with people who there. You're a lot more narrow minded as a child and getting bullied can make it seem like your entire life is ruined. I think it's a bigger problem now because of technology. Before a child would only get bullied during school hours, hopefully outside of the sight of a teacher. Now children can be bullied 24/7 through technology since everyone has a cell phone and uses social media. It's a hard problem to solve.  ||| I wish there was more details...How did this happen? Did maybe the kid fall off the cliff and when his father tried to save him, he also fell off? Were they running and didn't realize they were able to fall off a cliff? This is just a strange and really sad story. I hope that somebody puts fencing alongside where they fell, so this doesn't happen to anyone else.  ||| I really hope the guy who caused this accident wasn't street racing. That's so unbelievably dangerous and stupid. The dad and surviving family could maybe cope with it a little better if the person who slammed into their relatives van wasn't doing anything stupid and it was just an accident. It's sad a sad story. Out of nowhere, half their family is dead, instantly.  ||| I can understand why Christians are leaving Iraq after all those atrocities committed by Isis. The Christians were kidnapped, tortured and eventually killed and dumped in unmarked mass graves. It's really sad that this could happen primarily because of religious differences. It's great that France granted some people asylum and I hope our government did the same. Those people need to be rescued so they can rebuild their lives.  ||| It's somewhat surprising that the EU wasn't in favor of making all elephants appendix 1. I can understand the population argument but you'd think that they'd be all over protecting elephants. I really didn't like that part about the couple countries voting to reopen the ivory trade. What's weird is the countries that want ivory trade have great elephant population statistics and the countries that want to protect elephants don't.  ||| I'm amazed that this ride just pass inspection just three days before a horrific accident. Someone needs to be accountable for this disaster. And if I ride is having mechanical problems throughout the day, how about you close it until it can be fixed? These mistakes have ruined several families. And it's even worse because the children watched the adults die. This is so sad.  ||| We really need to take measures to stop the rise of suicide of kids. This stuff should be discussed by parents and potentially in school also. I remember what being a kid was like and I remember being very over dramatic at times when small things went wrong. Just missing a tv show was enough to make me sad at times. And with so much media almost glamorizing suicide, it's important to make sure your kid isn't watching this kind of stuff.  ||| I can't even begin to understand what these women are going through. They finally escape Boko Haram and now they're getting mistreated by the same people that offered aid. These women must've trusted their \saviors\"" and that trust was abused. This honestly makes me sick. I hope the people who raped these women will be brought to justice and dealt with as harshly as possible. "" ||| It's really uplifting that people would notice animals suffering in a zoo and would plan a really complicated mission to save them. A mission where you need to have diplomatic talks with three different countries!! It really shows that some special people out there won't pass the buck to someone else, expecting someone else to do the heavy lifting to save something. I was really inspired by this article and I hope they end up setting up that animal center in Gaza.  ||| It's really sad that so many people need to flee from their war torn homelands for a better life. Those people must be so desperate to get into these overfilled boats when every day there must be a story about drowned migrants. A lot of the blame should go to the people who are organization these trips too. They are probably being paid handsomely but still can't transport the people safely.  ||| To be a bit blunt, I don't really care about these people. I don't think I even know who they are. My parents were divorced when I was young, so I can kind of relate. These people were way older than I was though, as I was around 8 or 9 years old. So they should be able to cope as their technically adults.  ||| I can barely believe that the events in that article were real. Such barbaric actions by ISIS...I feel so badly for the people who are forced to live side by side with such brutal people. I can understand why people are fleeing the area by the thousands. ISIS could basically kill you for any reason and likely wouldn't be challenged for their actions. This is such a disgrace.  ||| I didn't realize that the after effects of a fire could possibly be so deadly. This haze killed 100,000 people!! When Cali is burning, is there a similar haze that affects the surrounding states? This is quite a scary situation. And to think that the problem was exasperated by the cutting down of trees for palm oil. I hope there's a solution to this massive problem.  ||| The article really needed to go more into depth about the problem. The piece wasn't really written for anyone to get emotional, it came across kind of cold. Like a minor newspaper article in a paper that needed to desperately fill space. Were they alluding to poachers or something? The article needed a lot more detail.  ||| This is one of the most disgusting things I've ever read. Two 11 year old girls go to work for a tailer and they are basically kidnapped and made slaves for 5 years!!! They finally were freed at 16 years old due to an amazing journalist who made an enormous impact on the lives of these girls and their families. The journalist should win multiple literary awards like the Pulitzer because of this.  ||| That little rhino really did fight for its life. I wonder that if where it was treated had electricity, maybe it could've survived? Also I wish what they reported what the little rhino died of. I can't imagine bundling a baby animal like that in my arms as its dying. And although it suffered quite a bit during that 48 hours and more that it was struggling, I hope that it's in peace, somewhere now. ","I didn't know that coal mining had such adverse effects on the environment. No wonder everyone wants green energy so badly... ||| Yeah for sure. The people are going to get all sorts of health problems and the animals are so desperate for food that they are attacking humans. ||| Yeah, it did seem little but Indians don't really make much money daily, compared to western countries. ||| I imagine it's every animal in the surroundings. It's just that only elephants are big and strong enough to do something about it. ||| Yeah and the lack of water too. They spoke about their wells drying up. ||| Maybe it's a matter of corruption? Since the officials didn't even make good on their promises regarding money for the land and work for one of the landowners sons. ||| True, so many other places mine coal still though, including America. Do you think our coal mines are this bad? ||| That's true, I wonder what regulations can do to prevent all the ash though? ||| That's good. One of the worst parts of that article was reading about the white ash covering everything. Reading about it might've been enough to give me cancer. ||| Yup. Do you think this article is old or basically present day? ||| That's sad. I've read recently that India has started more recycling and other measures to take care of the enviroment. ||| Yeah, it's likely the cities that will start with the new reforms. ||| True. Squeeze all the money you can out of the land without caring about the people, animals or general environment until it's too late. ||| Yeah and it was probably children working in there too. ||| It's a terrible way to die too. So much suffering. I wonder if the mine workers in India are suffering from that too? ||| It was nice talking to you about this unfortunate topic. Have a great day! ||| bye ||| Yeah for sure...Do you think you personally would return to Mosul if you were a Christian? ||| I agree, there would be a longing to fix the area and to prevent a similar disaster from happening again. ||| I don't even think they have the powers or the numbers to fix anything. They were a minority before all the bloodshed and they are losing members every day. ||| It's a little like solving racism. What are the Christians really supposed to do? Tell the fanatical Muslims to not kill them because of their religion? ||| An army for what? Like an Israel vs the middle east situation? Where they basically stockpile weapons and a serious war could break out at any time. ||| I think the internet is the only way to solve it. Once people talk to the other side and see they are just people like everyone else. ||| The way I see it, is growing up their family and friends are constantly pounding into their heads, \hate the west.\"" Then they go on a computer and play video games with American or European people and see that they aren't so bad. There's no reason to hate these people."" ||| Yeah, once people are set in their ways, there's no changing their prejudices. You basically have to wait for the older people to die off... ||| Also I think it's only a small fraction of the fanatical Muslims that are to blame. ||| Yup. Anyway, it was really nice of France to welcome Christians that feared going back to Mosul. ||| I doubt that any French people would volunteer for that... ||| Yeah. Do you think America took in a lot of asylum seekers from this tragedy? ||| I think they have a lottery for Christians from Middle Eastern countries. ||| Yeah but the amount of people that need help and assistance is far more people than we can handle. That's millions of people! ||| Yeah, that makes sense. I hope in the next couple of generations the tension in the Middle East will finally be released. ||| bye ||| Hey, I didn't realize that polar bears depended on the arctic ice so much for their hunting.. ||| Yeah but I thought of them as nimble creatures. Like an better version of a bear. And basically they way they hunt is by ambushing seals at ice openings. ||| Yeah and they definitely require a big food source. ||| Yeah, it'd have to be whenever NASA gets mentioned in an article lol. ||| I think the ice caps melting has been covered a lot. Al Gore kept talking about the polar bears in his first global warming movie. ||| Yeah but beyond reversing global warming, I'm not sure how they can fix it. Maybe introduce new land animals for the polar bears to hunt? ||| That's true but these animals wouldn't necessarily need to live long. Just long enough to wind up in the jaws of a hungry polar bear. ||| It would indeed be expensive. If the idea was floated to animal conservation groups, I think it could be funded. ||| Yeah there could be transportation issues. Acquiring the penguins would be the easy part. Right now I think the majority of polar bears are still surviving. If there was a possibility of them going extinct due to a lack of food, I have no doubt that we could save them, somehow. ||| Have you ever seen a polar bear in a zoo? I'm not sure if I have. ||| Yeah, I just googled it and there's lots of cool videos on youtube. Also sometimes they build big enclosures for one type of animal. There could be a polar bear national park or something in the arctic. ||| Some animal animal conservation groups have deep pockets. ||| Probably, getting grants for studying environmental problems are probably easier to acquire than for other subjects. I just googled some polar bear stuff and there was an article from 2018 talking about the problem. They said the main issue with low polar bear populations is inbreeding. Also they discussed Canada air dropping food and said it would cost 2 million a month. ||| I think they're only going to drop food when they notice that the bears are starving. Also that 2 million was to just feed 5,000 polar bears. ||| They might have, I was skimming it fast so I could've missed it. It's great that the Canadian government is doing something about it though. I bet our government is also taking steps to save the majestic animal. Thanks for the conversation, hope you have a good day. ||| bye ||| bye ||| Yeah, it's really unfortunate that some countries value ivory so highly. ||| Yup. Were you surprised that the EU wasn't in favor of classifying all elephants as appendix 1? ||| What's weird is that they think poachers care about imaginary lines when they're already committing a crime. ||| They are really well equipped too, they are almost like soldiers now. I think the article said that poachers fire on sight when encountered. ||| If only there was a way to devalue Ivory, so there wasn't any point in killing elephants. I remember reading an article a long time ago when groups tried to flood the ivory market with fakes to lower prices. ||| Yeah. I think there was also another tactic they tried, which was painting the tusks pink or something. ||| I've heard of those rampaging elephant stories in the past. What happens is that people keep cultivating land that elephants previous used. So the elephants are forced to interact with people to find food. ||| Probably not, unless it becomes a really dire situation. The EU had their chance of really stepping up the penalties that poachers would face and they didn't take their chance. ||| It's supposed to be 10 turns each lol. Also I just googled what ivory went for....In 2016, they went for $1,500 a pound and they can weigh up to 250 pounds...Easy 400k. ||| Yeah it's probably doubled since its getting harder and harder to sell it. ||| Yeah, I can't even imagine that many dead elephants...There was also the statistic that one gets killed very 15 minutes. Elephants are such smart creatures too, they have funerals for dead family members. It's so sad....Also the terms are on the left side, 10 turns minimum which we've reached or 15 turns each for a bonus. ||| bye ||| That article really made me emotional...It's so sad when children are bullied and aren't able to fix the situation. ||| Yeah. In the article they said that France was lagging behind Sweden and a couple other countries, I bet America is lagging behind France. ||| It's almost an impossible issue to deal with. Every kid has a cell phone and social media. So there's the potential for them to be bullied 24/7. ||| Yeah, especially if you think about what kind of a dark mindset you need to be in to actually want to commit suicide as a child. It's hard to imagine that level of suffering. ||| Do you think a little bullying is needed to build a strong enough character to deal with reality as you grow older? ||| Yeah, so really the only difference between youth of today and past generations being able to deal with being bullied is the internet and social media. ||| Sometimes a good teacher can save children in this situation. They just have to notice it and discipline the other kids early. ||| That's truly horrifying if a teacher takes part in the bullying. Good job on making sure your children have a good self esteem. ||| That's true. Other adults are really the only ones who can do something about it. Outside of a parent complaining. ||| Yeah, that's simply good parenting. Also I remember all the shows that I would watch as a little kid always had lessons. They tried to imprint on you to not hurt others or steal or anything else bad. TV shows are probably why I never seriously bullied anyone. ||| Do you think today's tv shows that target youth aren't as educational as in the past? (do you want to keep going or end?) ||| bye ||| Yeah...Whenever I'm on a huge roller coaster or something, I always have the thought that I just could fly out and die. And I guess that's where some of the excitement comes from. For these lives to be ruined on that ride though, it's terrible. ||| I agree. The boat or whatever they were on capsizing is basically the only way you could get hurt. This story makes me angry too, how could a ride with so many problems pass inspection 3 days earlier? ||| Yup. Also that ride was problem plagued pretty much the entire day. If they're having that much trouble with a relatively simple ride, how about you shut it down for the day?? ||| I think 3rd world countries are the only ones with less restrictions than America lol. At least they shut the park down but I think we would do that too. ||| I think that's a little bit of an irrational thought. It happens to everyone though. Just because a plane crashes doesn't mean you should drive 30 hours to your destination instead. Roller coasters are a little bit different but on those water rides, you probably have a .0000000001% chance of dying. And I haven't been to an amusement park in a while. I go to fairs sometimes though and I doubt they have much restrictions regarding ride safety. ||| You probably feel worse after reading this story lol. And the problem with these small fairs is they probably can't afford the safety checks and engineers to properly maintain the ride. ||| Yeah and the food is usually incredible too. I love fairs!! Do you think the park will be liable for this accident? Or maybe you waive your rights when you purchase tickets? ||| If they are liable, they're in trouble. I'm not sure how much money it would require to replace having a mother for your life. And that's just the one person, I think four people died in this situation. ||| I wish there was more details...How/Why did they fall off a cliff?? ||| Maybe a really powerful snow storm so they didn't have visibility? ||| There's snow on mountains there tho! Good place to ski/snowboard. ||| I really doubt that. How exactly would that happen? Like in a cartoon, someone switched a sign or something so they walked straight off a cliff?? ||| Do you think they might've been pushed? My first thought was the son might've slipped or something and the father was unable to pull him up. So they both fell. ||| Yeah, I didn't realize the full scope of what you meant by foul play. They could've been robbed/killed and then just tossed off a cliff. ||| Yeah, that seemed really unlucky. The father/son must've survived the cliff fall though. Otherwise why was the helicopter issue relevant? ||| I don't know if I'd go that far. Just bad luck...Airplanes are really well maintained and they still have all sorts of problems that result in delays. ||| I'd hope the trail didn't lead to it. Maybe they weren't on a trail and were just hiking? It'd be nice if the local government put fencing or something around where they fell, so this doesn't happen again. Also it's strange that the article didn't talk about the part of their family that survived this tragedy and are grieving now. ||| I wonder if they're thinking that if they also went on this trip, they could've prevented this...Just an all around sad situation. ||| Maybe. Especially if the father/son were still alive and potentially could've been treated at a hospital if not for the helicopter issues. Or maybe the local government could be blamed for not maintaining the trail they were on (do you want to continue or end)? ||| Yeah, it would've been nice to see some statistics regarding falls/fatalities in the area but once again, the article failed us... ||| We can assume that it was steep enough to do some serious damage. How do you think people were alerted to this accident? ||| And there had to be someone who called it in, unless the father or son were in good enough condition to dial 911. ||| Yeah, I wonder if this was a popular hiking destination? Also I wonder what kind of evidence there would be if foul play occurred? Maybe branches broken in weird ways that show a struggle occurred? ||| bye ||| Wow, that's terrible. How old was the child? ||| That's so sad. Do you know if the punishment was a one time thing or if the child was often disciplined? ||| Yeah and with the internet, it's really easy for a kid to google to find out a suicide method. ||| Yup, kids grow up sooooooo much faster than in previous generations because of our media. ||| I don't think the world is in that much of a sorry state. This is probably the best time to ever be alive. It's just news is constantly doom and gloom. Bullying is probably one of the biggest reasons for children suicide. ||| The only solution I think can think of is to monitor your child's internet use. That is way overbearing though. Maybe in the future, AI could be trained to monitor these kinds of problems. ||| Yeah but it really takes patience and persistence. I remember not really wanting to talk to my parents about school related things even though I had a good relationship with them. Somehow ensuring that your children have a good friend network would also be important. They shouldn't ever feel alone in the problems their having. ||| Yeah, I'm just seeing through the kid perspective and the kinds of conversations I had with my parents. I just wanted them to be over so I could talk about what I wanted to talk about. Something needs to be done though, as car accident fatalities and homicides went down but suicides went up... ||| Yeah and perhaps there could be a technology solution. Hold on a sec, need 10 turns! ||| bye ||| It was honestly disgusting. The women managed to survive one atrocity and now are being mistreated by the same people who \saved\"" them."" ||| Yup. And those women must've trusted those soldiers too, out of desperation. And 2.5 million people were displaced!! Such a terrible situation. ||| They probably grew up knowing nothing except constant battle and death. Just trying to survive another day... ||| Their fathers were probably dead or fighting against Boko Haram. It's such a sad situation. ||| Isn't this basically modern times in Africa? This is still a big issue. Boko Haram still exists. ||| I think part of their group is aligned with ISIS and to my knowledge, ISIS is barely alive after losing so much territory. ||| Yeah but it takes a lot of killing to make them disappear. It's a good thing Trump was so motivated to finally end their terror. ||| Yeah. Also we need to strengthen some areas in the middle east so they aren't as easily destroyed if a new ISIS like group is formed. ||| That's a tough question. It could be argued that ISIS even existed in the first place because of the power vacuum we left in Afghanistan and Iraq when we supplanted their governments. I honestly think we should quit being the world police for a while until most problems in America are solved. So much money was spent in the middle east in the past 20 years. ||| Yeah, we have plenty of issues here!! Nice talking to you as well, bye. ||| Yeah...I don't necessarily think the violence in the area had much to do with the terrible conditions in the zoo. The zoo owners cared more about profit than the conditions of the animals. ||| The owners just weren't equipped, knowledge wise, for this task. I don't think the tiger being fed chicken all its life was a consequence of the area. The owners were just clueless and blamed the conflict for their inadequacy. And I agree, the animals are always innocent and I hope they are enjoying themselves right now! ||| I can slightly understand that issue though. People in Venezuela have enough problems feeding themselves! It's truly a dire situation over there. ||| Speaking of poaching, I had an article about elephant tusks a couple days back. And I later googled that elephant tusks go for around 400k. And in poor areas in Africa, that's basically lottery money. And at that point, I'm not sure you can even blame the poachers. You blame the people who are buying the ivory and elephant parts for ancient medicine stuff. It's disgusting that they think elephant or whale parts will affect diseases. ||| That price was from an article in 2016. And since they've outlawed the sale of all ivory, the price has probably doubled or tripled. The people who are hunting these amazing animals are decked out like soldiers...Anyway, this article really inspired me. A guy saw that animals were being mistreated and immediately started planning on how to save them. ||| That's commendable. If I had saw this though, I doubt I would've done anything. Most people would only go as far as complaining on social media. While this guy is having diplomatic talks with three different countries while navigating missiles and manages to rescue the animals! ||| You must've really wanted to adopt some of those animals too. It's so easy to get attached to them! And who knows, if America was a warzone, maybe you would've done something similar like this guy. ||| Yeah, I've read about cases like that so often on Imgur. You just give them a little love and they are whole new animals. ||| And the sad thing is, even if you mistreat a dog so badly...They will still forgive you. And animal's ability to forgive far exceeds a humans. ||| Some people are so wounded inside that the only way they can cope is to wound something else, that is equally as powerless. Anyway, I hope that tiger is still roaming that sanctuary today. Also it would be nice if the guy from the article manages to set up that animal area in the Gaza strip that the article mentioned. It was nice talking to you. ||| bye ||| Yeah, it's a shame. There must be a safer way to transport these people than them having to take their chances on an overcrowded boat. ||| I'm not certain this has anything to do with immigration because the countries they are fleeing to will accept them. Even the coyotes or whoever these people are paying to transport them to different countries are misleading them. As in the article, it said that the leaders of these trips are saying that if you get saved, they will take you back to Libya. ||| Yeah, that's true. I didn't consider that. I think a land trip would be even more perilous. It would take longer and the already poor people would need more supplies. And how are they going to carry those supplies? ||| As mentioned in the article regarding the rescue boats, I think the responsibility of transporting these people should go to the country that's willing to accept them. I don't think the cost would be that exorbitant. ||| That doesn't make sense, as the countries that receive these people are going to pay their living costs for years. Coming off that boat, these people will only have the clothes on their back. They will likely also need to be taught the local language. The big problem with immigration is the government in on the hook for the needs of the people for a long time. ||| Some people will likely be educated enough to support themselves. I think the majority would need assistance for quite a while. Housing assistance, education assistance, food assistance ect will be required for these people to survive. A few years ago Germany offered to pay migrants a full years worth of rent costs to return home. They also offered to give a lump sum for the migrants to open a business in their home country. This migration and the costs assorted with it are why some Europeans are electing conservative politicians. It's entirely why brexit happened, as the EU was forcing countries to accept migrants. ||| 4k people have been lost because the people are desperate. And even if the boat idea doesn't seem like a good one, they will take that chance anyway. Some countries have problems with immigration but others, like Germany, are still accepting people with open arms. The EU in general is still pro immigration. And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket. And I think you're underestimating how difficult it will be for these people to assimilate. Maybe it's different in others places but I highly doubt I could get a job anywhere if I couldn't speak the language. ||| Yeah, it's easier to assimilate here as no matter what ethnicity you are, there's pockets of that group of people living together in every major city. ||| Maybe if it was a massive, massive company like Apple or Amazon. Even then, I doubt it would happen if the company was publicly traded. They'd get rid of that CEO ASAP. It would have to be the government as they would rightfully take losses to protect the lives of people. I don't think it's that crazy to ask the EU to help transport these people. Unless the representatives of the countries are only virtue signaling and don't actually want to accept the people. ||| That sounds like a good solution. I'm hoping that the article was a bit old and migrants aren't drowning as often now-a-days. It was nice talking to you, have a good night. bye ||| Hey, I can't even imagine what that father was feeling after hearing about that accident... ||| If he ever does, it will take years. I can't even imagine hearing about such an accident. In mere moments, half your family is wiped away. ||| It's hard to tell, wouldn't the evidence be overwhelmingly obvious? ||| I guess by not driving recklessly and paying attention while you're driving. If it had been street racing, I'm assuming the racing car would've been going really fast and that would've affected the accident. ||| Wasn't there one or two survivors in the van? And depending on how the van was (lacking safety features), you could probably die after an accident while going 60 mph. ||| I think I read that a relative survived the crash, I could've been mistaken. Anyway, I think it probably wasn't street racing. Police are used to estimating speeds due to skid marks and the damages to the vehicles. Although it's possible that the VW was flooring it and lost control before going that fast. And I've found that accidents are semi random and the damage to you has more to do with how you react (less damage if you didn't react). I hit a huge buck at 50 mph or so and completely totaled my car but didn't have a scratch on me. I've been in a minor accident as a passenger and I didn't feel good for a couple days. ||| Do you think the survivors felt guilty at all? It's such a unique circumstance. And yeah, head on collisions are the worst. ||| I don't know...if I was in that circumstance, I would probably keep asking myself why this happened. Why didn't I ask if we could leave later or drive to a different location instead? There would be a million what if questions in my head. And why was I spared? ||| Yeah, basically. I haven't actually been in the situation so maybe there wouldn't be any guilt. From watching movies though, whenever this kind of thing happens, the main character always wishes that they somehow delayed the person who ended up killed. And if they had managed to do so, then the beloved person would still be alive. ||| They say football is a game of inches and life is an even better example. I hope that family was able to heal after this devastating accident. It was nice talking to you, have a good day. ||| bye ||| I don't think you can say it's ALWAYS sad, as there's plenty of circumstances in which a divorce is healthy for all parties involved. ||| I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better. ||| I was crushed by it as a child. As an adult though, I think it was a good idea. I just didn't understand the differences they had as a child. I tried to ignore the numerous arguments everyday. ||| Yeah, stellar journalism lol. The article being brief was probably the point. This is a study afterall. ||| I honestly think humans aren't meant for these long term relationships. No matter how great your spouse/girlfriend is, you will tire of her eventually. And the reasons that they annoy you will keep multiplying until you ask yourself what the point of this relationship is. ||| I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people. ||| It also brings excitement. When an attractive girl comes into your life, whether its because she works with you or she's a friend of a friend, everything gets more exciting. You care about whether you wore nice looking clothes and whether your haircut is on point. The chase is probably the most exciting part of life. ||| Our base needs are basically that and filling our stomachs lol. ||| Oh, I didn't even consider that you were possibly making fun of me. I'm easy going, even if you had been, I wouldn't care. When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind? ||| If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a good day. ||| bye ||| It's absolutely terrible...I can hardly believe that it's real. These fanatical ISIS people are barely human... ||| It seems you could lose your life for basically any reason. Imagine getting killed because they discovered you had a cell phone!! ||| I can totally understand why millions of their citizens have fled to other countries for safety. ||| Yup, I would do anything to get out. I would be insanely desperate. ||| Yeah, it's a wonder that they can get away with doing it. The regular people have the numbers vs these ISIS fanatics but sadly they probably don't have any weaponry. ||| That's understandable, it's difficult to face murders who will kill you for any reason. ||| Yeah, thank god they've basically been beaten. ISIS has lost nearly all of the land that they controlled in prior years. ||| Yup, one of the best things that Trump did. He was really motivated to stamp them out ASAP. ||| It really should've been done years ago. In the past, we would only arm the Iraqi and Afghanistani soldiers. And then ISIS would attack them, the defending soldiers would flee and ISIS would just take their gear and weapons. ||| Yeah, though I believe they are nearly finished already. Evil like this will probably always exist though...It was nice talking to you. bye ||| Hey, that was probably the most surprising thing that I'd read today. I didn't realize that haze could kill 100,000 people! ||| Did they ever complain about the after effects of the fires? ||| Definitely scary!! California is constantly on fire, do we have a harmful haze too? ||| It's more surprising to me when California isn't on fire... ||| I'm on the east coast but I have relatives in San Diego and they're constantly telling me horror stories about fires. A few times their house was a mile or so away from getting destroyed. ||| Yup, life is like that though. Never know when you're going to experience a disaster. Btw, if you ever experience a fire endangering your home, turn on your sprinkler system. It has saved many million dollar homes. ||| Neither, although my phone gets tornado warnings all the time lol. I've never experienced one before. ||| Did you have a basement to shelter in? I think that's what you're supposed to do. I'm in NY btw. Why did your family decide to stay? ||| Scary! I would've evacuated asap. I've seen too many rescue videos because people were too stubborn to leave. Good thing it ended up going ok though! ||| Yeah, I knew some sections of the country didn't have basements. They are nice though!! And nice talking to you too! bye ||| Yeah, I really wish the article had more details though. ||| Yup, the way it was written, I assumed it was a poacher situation. ||| It also would've been nice to see how much the polar bear numbers are declining because of the visitors. ||| Yup, it reminded me of a terrible newspaper article written to fill space. ||| Lol, not so fast. It's pretty much a dead profession with all the papers going bankrupt. Although I guess you could write internet pieces. ||| Yeah, now it's all about reading breaking stories on twitter and other social media. ||| Yeah ands sometimes the article titles are misleading, only to generate interest in an article on a different website. ||| Do you think it meant visitors as in tourists? Or maybe people moving to areas that previously were wilderness? ||| Probably. I guess their furs would be valuable. I agree that something really needs to be done about this. ||| Yeah, everything corruptable about humans usually comes down to money. People need to value nature more than money, especially since we are losing different species of animals and plant life every couple years. It was nice talking to you. ||| Yup. bye ||| It was sad, especially since it might've been a protected species of rhino. ||| I think it was some kind of animal sanctuary. Probably in a poor place too, as they didn't have power in their facility. ||| I guess for heating? The person in the article was trying to wrap the baby rhino with blankets to keep its body temperature high. Also power would help with treating these animals. ||| I'm not sure, as the article didn't go that in depth. The baby rhino probably could've been saved from whatever it was ailing from. Whatever it was, it killed the rhino after it fought for life for 48+ hours. ||| I haven't the slightest idea. Maybe some kind of rare disease? ||| I think it was really young, I don't quite remember specifics though. I think it had a 2 in there, so either 2 days/months/years old. ||| Probably a bit more musty than what a human baby smells like. What do you think? Also rhino's are such cool creatures, I remember seeing them at the Philly zoo. Have you ever seen one in person? ||| Yup, poaching semi-defenseless animals is such a disgusting thing. The only plus side is that I think rhinos grow their horn back if it's damaged or cut off by poachers. ||| I think it's an ethical thing. Also most people have no use for rhino horns. It's only Asian medicine techniques that require them for good health or whatever. ||| Yeah, it's a really unfortunate situation. Hopefully younger people in those areas grow up with more appreciation towards exotic animals and no longer purchase these kinds of things. It was nice talking to you. ||| I guess the easiest way would be if poachers killed the mother/father rhino. Do you know if father rhinos care for the young rhinos too? ||| I guess some people must've stumbled on the young rhino. Similar to when kittens and puppies are sent to shelters. Also the rhino might've not been orphaned, it could've just been born in the animal sanctuary. ||| They are wild animals, so I imagine they would be unpredictable. If you don't intrude on their space, I don't think they would attack you needlessly. ||| I guess for defense mostly, since they don't even eat meat. Also maybe as a way of getting mates somehow? Anyway, it was nice talking to you. bye"
p044,Considering the analysis made in the article i read concerning the death of birds via wind energy company turbines e.g Altamont Pass is really an alarming cause for the issue to resolved and i highly suggest that fine be paid by companies who directly or indirectly affect ecology as drastic as the analysis made in the article to be convinced the researchers made analysis of the Isotopes of the Birds Feathers. ||| The terrific massacre that happened a year ago is really a bad situation to be in.

p045,"The situation in Kashmir has been difficult for some time. I'm not sure, though, if India wants to keep good relations with their provinces, why they would do these kinds of things.

It's largely the fault of the Western World to begin with, historically. ||| Ture enough. I think about how much the Dutch are still exploiting for diamonds, for example. ||| I think that in the absence of solid help from us they need to band together, unforunately they have more than their share of opportunists as well. ||| I'm not great on the history of Africa, but I know we've heard of several warlords turned presidents who have just been terrible. ||| I was trying to understand that too. I've had friends who have gone over there to do charity work, fortunately nothing like that happened to any of them. ||| Most definitely, and I think it's key, rather than just throwing a few dollars at the problem.

I can't imagine how bad they feel and how helpless they felt seeing their family member going through something and not being able to help them. I hope that mental health services improve so that things like that don't continue to happen. ","I found the article to be sad. ||| It is and it is so difficult for people to seek help. ||| Yeah, it did, I feel so bad for her family. ||| Considering how many famous people seem to go through that, yeah it doesn't seem to matter. ||| I guess it could, especially if people have to put up a happy face for the public. ||| Yeah, but I think it is difficult to know what to do when someone you love is going through things that you don't understand. ||| Yeah, but maybe they thought that if they hovered too much, she would feel even worse, I don't know. ||| It is something that people don't know much about especially considering how people ignored or locked away people who went through those things in the past. ||| Yeah and they tend to shame people who seek help. ||| Yeah, I don't know why that is. People have no problem seeking help when it comes to physical problems like a broken arm, but when it comes to mental problems forget about it. ||| I think that is better than it used to be. ||| Yes, and people are being more understanding about it. ||| Yeah, it is has so be so hard for them. ||| Yeah, and it probably doesn't stop after somebody kills themselves. They probably still go through that their whole lives, what could they have done differently. ||| Oh yeah, so many hateful people who don't care who they hurt. ||| I hope so. ||| same to you, goodbye"
p047,"This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing  ||| It's crazy how you can lose your life so easily! Imagine how that poor kid will feel when she wakes up from the hospital and realizes her whole family is gone. Can't even imagine. Makes me sick thinking about it. I sincerely hope she has other close relatives who can be there for her because she will need all the support she can get.","HI. Isn't it unfortunate that this is happening to people in 2019? ||| I know I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly behind. ||| Yeah. I understand logically why that would be an option but I just can't imagine it. And especially when there's a food and fuel shortage. ||| Yes. And then not having access to basic medications. There seems to not even be a safe zone for doctors to treat anyone. ||| True. Seems like it would be. I haven't kept up to date with this story but I wonder how these people are getting into Turkey. Are they crossing illegally or being given refuge? I'm not sure. ||| Yeah I hadn't either. I knew of the Syria crisis in general but thought people were being taken to countries in Europe. ||| I don't know either. I researched quickly and see why the doctors are fleeing. A hospital was bombed two weeks back. Crazy. We're such a violent lot of animals. ||| Evil. I can't think of a better word. I guess they're using phone data to chat through Skype. Surprised no one's blown up the cell towers. ||| Same. I was making good money and this story puts a downer on the day. I hope more countries in that area take some people in. I can't believe other Middle Eastern countries aren't taking refugees. Or I assume they're not since I never hear about it. ||| Yes! That's all you hear about here is people squawking about taking those on the brink of death and/or starvation in. It's embarrassing sometimes. People don't realize it doesn't have to be forever. Just maybe until the war is over and the area is rebuilt. ||| I think it's easy to have that mentality if you've never seen it up close and personal for some people. I have some people like that in my family and I know their opinions would change if they area had to stay in such a place for any period of time. I think this is our last turn? ||| Laugh out loud yeah. Ok, thanks for the chat. Bye. ||| bye ||| I know and that poor kid who was left behind, I can't imagine how she'll feel. ||| Yeah. She's going to have a rough future. I hope she has a good network of extended family members for support. ||| Just a baby. Terrible. I wonder why they were hit. I imagine the driver is going to feel awful for a long time too. ||| Yeah and likely in a small town too. Won't be able to stay there long. ||| Yeah. I think another woman and her kid were injured. Probably will be traumatized. The driver of the trailer probably will need some therapy. ||| Disturbing. I wonder how fast the guy who hit them was going if he had just turned. Must've been pretty fast to hit the trailer hard enough to knock people off and kill some of them. ||| Agreed. Likely drinking since it was Halloween but I don't know since the story didn't say. Could've been really dark if it was in a rural area like most of Mississippi. I'm from Alabama and it's not so great to drive there at night. ||| Yes, I was taught that too. Seen many semi trucks fly right on through. ||| Yeah. They're bad in Texas, at least on the interstates. I just try to stay out of their way. ||| It was nice talking to you as well. Have a great day. bye ||| bye"
p048,"It's crazy that random accidents like this happen everyday. I am not a baseball fan but of course enjoy a baseball game every now and again. I lived and worked in Miami too so I am vaguely familiar with that baseball player who unfortunately passed away. The effort to save him was great but unfortunately bad things seem to happen every day. He was so young too so it makes it worse.  ||| It's pretty heartbreaking to hear and read stories about suicide. I have always felt like there is more that can be done for mental health with young and older people these days.  It's not only the youth that struggle with it but it seems so normalized at a younger age. I feel strongly that there is no excuse for someone to kill themselves.  Anything can be prevented and anyone can be helped. It's a hard time and age though and usually those kids feel like there is nothing left for them to live for when in reality they have an entire wonderful life ahead of themselves, regardless of past experiences. But that's just my opinion.  ||| It's funny to read snippets of celebrity lives. I don't follow much celebrity news at all and find most of it pretty terrible usually. I don't have much sympathy for them either. Unfortunately most of their actions are money or popularity driven. I also think they really don't take marriage seriously because the divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous. They want to live fast and free and they tend to not make the greatest decisions. Not saying all are like that, but it seems like most.  ||| You would never even realize how relevant world hunger is until you read articles like this. We are so lucky in the US to not have to worry about kids going hungry. Most schools are starting to offer free lunches to kids too here in the US that they are really trying to combat it but we aren't doing much for other countries. There isn't always a whole lot we can do for other countries but there could be some things done to improve world hunger.  ||| Isn't it scary that so many bad things can happen to children and adults these days? After reading the article about a young boy falling in to a well and being found dead after 5 days, I can't even imagine the horror the boy faced but also the pain that his parents have to endure for the rest of their lives. It's quite sad and unavoidable at times. I highly doubt his father could have ever imagined his son falling into the well that they probably work at every day.   ||| I'm not a huge fan of the Clinton's so it's hard for me to feel for this lady when the article is mainly about how Clinton's thought she was a wonderful lady. With political bias' aside, I think Parkinsons disease is devastation to have. My husband's grandma suffers from it but still has a very positive outlook on life.  ||| I can't even imagine getting a text saying we needed to evacuate. It doesn't seem real. We live in a country where that would not be likely to happen but if it did, it would be a total shock for most Americans. I can't even imagine what chaos that would create. That would probably turn the world upside down. I emphasize with those civilians but I can't even imagine being in that position.  ||| It really does break your heart to have to read about all these foreign countries that suffer so much from hunger. You never really realize how lucky we are until you're reminded by these news articles and stories. You want to do so much but yet will any of it really help? I can't help but think that charities and donating isn't the best option because how is one to know if it's really worth it when a lot of these companies have overhead and issues within their own charities. I hope they have improved and continue to improve from this crisis. ||| I continue to read these stories and they always spark sympathy but then it's always the same outcome for these situations. People are fights and warring and there is not much that we can do about it. How much can one person do to fix these issues? I just hope that their future is brighter than it seems. That's what is always so hard to express or imagine. I'm a sure believer that God has the power and so I think they will come out on top with that attitude.  ||| I love animals, I truly do. Although, I will never say animals are above humans. This article really lacks more information. They don't go in to why the wolf was shot by the government sniper. I just don't agree that there wasn't a threat of some sort that would create someone to do this. They are wild creatures that could have actually hurt a human. I am all for saving and helping animals and ensuring their well-being but this story may or may not have to do with that. ","Hey how are you? Are you a baseball fan? ||| I am not a fan but yes such a tragedy. I can ||| Exactly. He was so young too. I can't even fathom losing a son so young. Parents should never have to bury their children but you hear it happening almost every day these days. ||| Most definitely. It makes you just want to hug your loved ones because you never know what'll happen. ||| No, it's really not. You take each day for granted. I am in a season of my life where I just keep wishing the days away and hoping time speeds up. But it's no way to live because you miss the small moments! ||| Oh, nothing bad. Really good actually but I am 7 months pregnant and it's just not fun. haha So I just want it to be December already. ||| Thank you much. It's a great thing but just exhausting as expected! ||| Yes, that would be a hard loss. Unexpected deaths are obviously way harder. ||| Oh man. Especially when someone does it for a living, it's hard to have any sort of life altering injury. It definitely crushes their spirits. ||| goodbye. ||| Hello. How are you doing? Interesting article right? ||| You know, I rarely follow celebrity news at all so I actually learned a thing or two today! ||| Yes. And I mean I wouldn't blame the guy. Especially being 20 years older than her. Not exactly an easy age gap. ||| Very much so. The divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous because of their lifestyle. I always like to hear about celebs who've been married for 15+ years. It's so rare. ||| Exactly. I guess it would be difficult to be an actress and not feel like your own life is a movie, you know? Almost like they aren't in touch with reality. ||| There definitely a few who give more back and with the right intentions. Then there are those who just give back so they can look better. I could never imagine that life but honestly wouldn't want my whole life to be exploited either. ||| 100%. I'm such a believer that what is put out on the internet can be seen by literally anyone and everyone. It's so not safe and is easily used against you. I get documenting it but not posting it online for 100+ people to have access to. ||| It makes me cringe. I just don't understand it and it's creating such self-centered humans. ||| Exactly but I unfortunately don't think that it will be reversed any time soon. It's only gotten worse so who knows where it will lead. ||| I believe it's how the story made you feel. I think that's how I generally answer! Usually they are actually like sad stories or emotional stories but I think this is the first one I've read that wasn't \sad\"""" ||| Thanks! goodbye ||| Well it's an interesting article. I think with all political bias' aside, Parkinson's disease is not a fun illness to live with. What do you think about it? ||| Yes. It's slightly hard to have sympathy for her specially unfortunately. Not a huge fan of the Clinton's either so their opinion of her isn't helping her case. ||| Yes exactly. I'm not much in to politics but this made me chuckle because it seemed very bias. I'm sure this lady wasn't perfect. ||| I can agree completely. It's the first article I've read on here that I didn't feel any sympathy to be honest ||| And I was slightly worried I would be matched with a hardcore Clinton lover and it was going to get interesting! ||| I can 100% agree. I just don't understand the people who can read the news or media and not see the corruption. I rarely read it and can see it! ||| It's heartbreaking honestly. I have sympathy for those people for sure! ||| It's true. I do feel like media has such a strong impact on the next generation. People are so brainwashed. ||| It's crazy really. I do so much research just on selecting a new brand of bread! ||| goodbye ||| It wasn't a very pleasant read. I can definitely empathize with those people. ||| Yeah, I can't even imagine if that happened in America ||| Exactly. It's not a good situation. But it could happen anywhere in all reality ||| Yeah, not much that can be done. Especially in these small countries that we don't hear about for months after the fact. ||| Yes, anyone in America should. Things like this seem to happen everywhere but there are still crap things that happen here too but just not to the extreme. ||| Well yes but even shootings occur in other countries on our level and we just hardly hear about them. It's crazy how much stuff we don't realize. ||| Yes exactly. They'd rather just put blame on other people and get on with their lives. ||| Exactly. It's sad that we can't do much but everyone has their own worries to worry about. Not saying their own worries are more important, but sometimes they are. ||| One can only hope but at the same time, probably not. ||| Exactly. goodbye. ||| Hey how are you doing? What did you think about the article? ||| I'm good. Yeah the article is sad. You don't really realize that a lot of countries still really struggle with hungry children. ||| Yes! Oh man, exactly. I feel like in America it's so easy just to throw away something because it's \expired\"" but really any one in any other country would still use those products."" ||| Yeah, that is a really tough concept to teach to kids. I'm lucky that mine are young enough to not know any different ||| I think government definitely has some influence on it but I'm not one to put the blame on something even when it's needed. Although it sounds like the government over there isn't ran very well. ||| Yeah, it seems like they don't allocate the money properly. I feel like here in the US they have more and more programs for kids in schools to get food even when they aren't at school. ||| It really is. I feel like we don't even realize how many countries actually struggle. But at the end of the day, how can we know for sure that the money or organizations we donate to are using the money properly? It's hard. ||| Yes, so have I. It's crazy what people do with money that should be going to something to help children. ||| Most definitely. It breaks your hear that some people will do anything for money. I am so minimalist that I would rather live with what's on my back than have anything extra. ||| Yes. It's a materialistic world these days. I wonder how different it may be in these other countries. I would love to travel and see it first hand because you'd really be able to emphasize with them more. ||| Very much so. It really is a blessing and a curse. I really think that some aspects have improved from technology but our interactions with others have decreased. ||| Yes oh yeah. I don't trust organizations enough currently. ||| Exactly. They have to get paid too so where does that money come from? ||| Yes yes yes. Because even if you were to give them money or food, the issue will repeat again and again. Especially if there is corruption with the government in those places. ||| Yes. I think also going to those places and helping first hand is more helpful too. ||| Not specifically. It was a pleasure speaking with you ||| goodbye ||| It's always so sad to read about these countries struggling with hunger. It constantly makes you feel like we don't do enough ||| Exactly. Not one family in even North America can say that they don't waste any food. ||| Oh yes. Even America's standards of expiration dates is a lie and we know it yet we still throw things away. We live in such a different way than them. ||| I honestly have not and that's only because I'm skeptical on whether it's really helping or not yanno ||| Yes. The charities are usually ran by companies and they have to pay their employees and so it just makes you wonder where that money is coming from. And even traveling to these countries is so hard to do but that's the only way I see us helping. ||| I do too. It's hard to know if it's improved in the last decade or if it is really getting worse. ||| Most definitely. You can't always believe what they are saying in the news. You almost want to hope they are lying in these situations. ||| That would be something. You would really have a story and strength if you are able to. ||| Yes. I can't imagine the people who would want these people to go hungry. ||| goodbye ||| It's always so hard to imagine these countries and the struggle they are experiencing. I wouldn't want to be in their situation and count my blessings. What about you?> ||| Exactly. I can't even imagine. Especially that old to have lost it all. ||| Yes that's very true. It's hard for me to imagine. Youth these days have it so much more difficult than us. ||| Oh wow. That hits home for you then. I just can't even imagine how they feel. I'm sure you deal with the anger and sadness from them ||| That's true. I can't imagine wanting to really want to talk about it, especially here in the US. I feel like it's such mixed emotions and opinions. ||| Oh wow. That is bazaar. That just makes matters so much harder. The system is unfortunately not the best. ||| Yeah, just completely random selections to make it seem unbiased maybe? I don't know enough about it apparently because I had no idea it was like that. ||| Oh wow. That's so tough but so awesome about the sponsorship. It makes it a tad better. ||| That's so great that you can help them. It's great to hear that people are actually putting valiant efforts into changing something about the struggles. You don't hear it often. I'll definitely look up the organization. What city is it based out of? ||| Thanks again. goodbye. ||| Well, I guess it's sad that a wolf died but I feel like there is more to the story that's not mentioned than just someone shooting a wolf... ||| Not really though. Wolves actually usually separate from their pack when they are looking for a mate and that's what this wolf was doing. It's still sad of course but the wolf may have been near humans and could have actually killed humans. ||| It is scary how easy some people can carry out these tasks. ||| Well, it is a wild animal that could and probably would have attacked a human if a human was near by. For me, a humans life is far above an animals life. ||| Well we can agree to disagree. I would never put an animals life above another humans or my own. ||| Of course but there are many times that it's acceptable in my opinion ||| yes of course. 100% do you not? ||| Exactly. Animals are unpredictable unfortunately in any capacity. ||| Yes they are. I think it would hit more at home if maybe it was a dog or cat for me. ||| goodbye. ||| It is truly unfortunate that this kind of stuff happens on an almost daily basis. I couldn't imagine being that boy's dad. ||| Exactly. His dad probably always took him out to help him work and he'd never imagine how unfortunate he'd be that day. ||| Very true. It just makes you really think about how lucky some of us are to be alive. Freak accidents happen everyday to people who I think don't deserve it. ||| Yes that's true. Especially if his dad was just a few feet away having to basically hear his child die. ||| Yeah, not ideal either way. I would not be able to live with myself if I had to endure either way. Just hopelessness I'm sure ||| It's a true wake up call for most I'm sure. ||| It really is. I don't understand the people who don't see it as that. Hopefully either restored completely or torn down completely but it is China so I'm sure safety standards are slightly different ||| Yes that's very true. I can relate. I'm out in the country but born and raised in a larger city and it still surprises me the differences here. ||| Yes of course. I just wonder how different it is in China. ||| That's very true. It could have been an unused well that was already in bad shape. ||| They may have not even realized it was there until it's too late. Sad to think this could happen to anyone. ||| No, I think we've exhausted most thoughts. goodbye"
p049,I feel so upset that someone in the name of god would think its okay to plan and carry out a plan to kill  a bunch of people . Just innocent people thinking they are about to go to a concert and enjoy themselves and there life is taken away in the blink of a eye and for what. What has to happen for more gun laws how many people have to be killed in such a senseless way . Its becoming that we are so use to people being killed in this mannor that it its almost becoming  the norm,
p050,"I find it disturbing that thousands of acres of forest land are destroyed to mining, foraging elephants attracted by the crops in the fields often enter villages, resulting in an alarmingly high number of human-elephant conflict situations. This shouldnt be. This is wrong. I mean the selfishness of some people shouldnt be a problem for all ||| Why do human have to be so wicked? I capture innocent animal from their homes, enslave them and deprive them of the right treatment. It is a very sad and wicked situation. We should leave things the way they are if we know we are not capable of affording these animals what nature will give them. We dont have to keep spoiling everything the nature begot in the name of domination. It is not right!!! ||| See how people are being wasted. It is always a very sad situation. Where is humanity? I hope we can be much more cautious and take necessary precautions when we should. The life we have is just one and we only live it once. More attention should be paid to guarding it judiciously. It is sad the way the life was lost...I wish I can help prevent it though. ||| WE keep fighting avoidable battles that leads to avoidable wars thereby losing lives and properties. We gather to scatter, we build to destroy. It is sad that the bigger countries keep maltreating the smaller ones and expect them to be silent about it. We all should embrace love and unity. That is where the strength of the world is. ||| There should be empathy to refugees. They didnt chose their situation. They are just victim of circumstances. I wish I can really help them. More love and support should be given to them. I dont imagine myself losing all the things I have. I cant count the number of times people have lost their homes and all ||| The ISIS need to be stopped. They cant keep killing people indiscriminately and feel they can do anyhow they want. With the level at which they operate, I wish more global powers will be raised against them to stop the nuisance they creating in the world. More attempt should be made to clip their wings.  ||| We always think the moment someone is rich and have enough money to throw around, they are void of worries and life problem. I mean here is someone who was bold enough to ask for help yet no one reached out to help. I feel so bad knowing this. Depression is real and hit even the most unsuspecting people. It is so bad that she died without anyone showing her true love. ||| Cancer s really not a good way to die. I am yet to get my head around the cause. It is always painful when people doe as a result. The last moment are always tearful for me and I usually find it very hard to stand it. I wish more research can be done to combat it...since no one really know the cause. ||| Cancer is a very dangerous disease and I love the fact that the woman fought to the end. I however hope more attention will be on the causes so people can properly prevent it. It always have a sad ending and only few people are able to survive it. I still believe the cure is out there but pharmaceutical companies are deliberately hiding it. ||| one would think the increased technological advancement would make people happier and less prone to suicide. It is sad that rather than curbing it, it has escalated it too much. Kids now getting depressed. I wonder why kids of nowadays are softer though. I mean, one would expect stronger kids and more emotional stability since we have everything easy ||| Humans are the most selfish and wicked of all creation. They treat the planet as they like and handle the animals with carelessness, forgetting that they have their own families and emotions. It is so sad that we take these animals away from their natural habitats and treat them unfairly. Mother nature treats them better than we do. ||| really? world worst zoo? Should we even have anything like that? It is a very pitiable state we've found our self in. Humans keep destroying everything Mother nature has bestowed us with. We pick up animals form their natural habitats, deprive them of social and emotional bondings with their kind and the best we can offer is deplorable habit. ||| Humans killing themselves in avoidable situations. Why cabt they just sit in their countries? I cant blame them though, the global unrest is alarming and people are just trying to survive. But travelling over the sea using such boats is pushing it too far. I feel sad and sorry for them and wish I can help their situation ||| It is so sad honest people become victims of environmental hazards. We make technological and industrial advancement without considering the effects on the environment.

It is so sad an earthquake of that magnitude hits New Zealand . ||| a man lost all he has. that is the saddest thing that can ever happen to anyone. I really dont want to experience this in my life...I mean, no man should experience it. how will he start ? where did he want to start from. The man should be given proper mental test and all..to prevent him from harming himself or even abusing substance. ||| I feel so sad for the man. I mean, he  couldnt keep up with Jolie's profile. I wish people should would do proper profiling of personalities before agreeing to settle down. Some are soft paced while others are fast.By understanding ourselves, we will know who and who not to have relationships or marriage with. ||| Divorce always make me sad. I dont like it when couples separate over avoidable causes. Things should be done to prevent them from going separate ways. I mean, they start their whole life differently. All the shared goals and ambition goes through the wind and they have to start from the scratch alone...individually. ||| I feel so terrible. These are totally avoidable situations and yet we keep losing live to it. Wild fire are dangerous and not only cause damage to properties globally, they also affect wild animals and lead to extinction of rare species. Men are also killed as a result. I think there should be a global effort to stop all form of indiscriminate bush burning.  ||| Awwnn..i dont like the fact that the pets died. I just wish I can protect the animals. They lost their home and that is really sad. The homeowners must be really devastated and weak. One terrible thing about losing pet is, you cant really get a proper replacement. I just hope they have some home insurance in place. ||| Air pollution is everywhere nowadays and I find it totally scary that the survival rates of those with lung cancer will be cut shorter.

Can we say our byes now? ||| ok ||| bye ||| I always find it painful ||| Yea, the woman is really a fighter. I love her. I lost an uncle to cancer last year ||| wow..that is sad. So sorry about that. Yea. I feel the pharmaceutical companies are deliberately keep it secret. ||| It really is pitiable. Its disturbing that human lives is not valued. ||| Might be a moment of self discovery for her. ||| It definitely will, but not so many people are willing to embrace it. ||| Yeah, many people tend to shy away from that though.

Can we please exchange our byes? ||| You too. You have to type bye too ||| Same here, it is really sad ||| Yea, with internet, we tend to compare our self with others. Personally, I see comparison as a form of motivation though, some people however get pressurized with it. ||| also, I feel this generation is weaker..lol ||| Yeah...more attention should be paid to emotional intelligence and maturity. ||| Lol..I say that a lot too. That is what stress can cause ||| It is sad..it all boils down to emotional intelligence. Many of these kids going into relationship aint matured enough ||| You have a solid point there. They dont get to discover the person who they really are... ||| Yea..it is selfishness on the kid's part ||| I wont like to be in that shoe...I really hope not to be ||| Depression is also a major culprit...I heard it is more mental than emotional ||| The drugs...I dont feel they really solve it. It is just to manage it. The pharmaceutical companies are all out for more profits ||| bye ||| Hello...it is really sad ||| It is totally beyond me..so sad ||| Yea. I find that pacifying to an extent. I dont like the idea of keeping animals in captivity ||| Exactly...if you can offer more than mother nature, dont keep them at all ||| It really does. Most of these caged animals dont get to meet their families before they die ||| Exactly. They have their intelligence too ||| I just hope I wont witness the day all the animals will go rouge on mankind ||| lol...i wont make that hasty conclusion ||| Yea. it is. Can we end the chat now? ||| bye ||| selfishness and wickeness of humans ||| I feel so terrible about it ||| What do you think can be done about it? ||| Good. I think animal captivity should be totally abolished ||| And strict monitoring should be on also..there should be polices that discourage confinement of animals. Reserves is much more better ||| Exactly my point ||| Well, on a light mood. I hope the animals wont one day decide to figh us back ||| I was just kidding ||| Yeah, we really should. ||| bye ||| let us talk about your feelings, how do you feel? ||| Exactly...we shouldt even have zoos in the first place. The worst we should have is reserves. It is so sad we confine animals ||| It is such a relief. There should be more policies to discourage such acts ||| Yes, No one wil have the time to look after them. There is hierarchy in human needs ||| No one..I know I wont for sure. I cant stand such sight ||| Exactly ..i feel so happy with that ||| Yes. the best is money. Can we end the chat now? ||| Oooh. alright then. Are you willing to help any organization with donation? ||| I guess I would do the same ||| bye ||| I tell you...i cant help the tears ||| It is so sad. It was really avoidable ||| Yes, by staying in their country ||| It is, but there are safer routes ||| They could have flown ||| True that, you have a point ||| That is very correct. Many of they left as a result of unrest in their countries. ||| The border cases? ||| We should be grateful for what we have ||| I feel there should be a global move for a more peaceful world. When the global security is given the needed attention, less people will embark on such odyssey. ||| exactly. can we end the chat now? ||| bye ||| Hello there.. ||| It is so sad...I wish it was averted ||| Yes, the aftermath is still there. It might take some five years ||| Exactly. I dont think that is in place yet ||| Tree planting will help. I just hope they are deeply rooted. They should build artificial embankments also ||| it is so sad and terrible ||| I would be upset too...\\ ||| Personally, i would move. I am sure most people would love to move too, but where is the resources? ||| Starting all over! they might not even be welcome in the new location ||| yeaa... guess we can say our bye ||| But really, can we just stop all the wars? ||| It is the selfishness of man that keep hurting humanity. ||| Countries will be jealous of each other...lol ||| lol..That is on a lighter note. ||| Exactly..that is the best we can do ||| I really wish I can do more ||| It is for real. I just hope the countries can come together ||| yes, we are the bigger brother ||| hahhah..that is so true. Guess we can exchnage our bye ||| I have no idea... ||| Yeah. Guess there was some sort of warnings. They kinda lucky when compared with less developed countries ||| Yea, Adrenalin sets in and they can take shelther ||| No I havent ||| I dont..I only skimmed it through ||| It wont be so easy to fix back...it would take years ||| Only flooding...massive one ||| My property was affected. We can exchange our bye ||| It is so sad...we really need more empathy for refugees. ||| I really dont know...Maybe donations ||| Exactly..the social unrest here and there ||| You have a good point with that.  People can easily pretend ||| that is correct..You cant take that away from those regions, lol. They love war ||| The internal crises should be sorted first I guess ||| bye ||| I feel that is the worst thing that can happen to a man ||| I tell you...I cant even imagine it ||| For real, so sorry about that. ||| I feel it will reduce it, that is only if everyone will use it. ||| And ti all got truncated like that. The man should be monitored though ||| I mean, he might become suicidal ||| Yeah. Guess we can exchange our bye now. Nice talking with you ||| Ohh...my bad ||| What sort of support can be done for the man? ||| Exactly, it will happen. ||| bye ||| Sorry? I dont understand you ||| OOh..that. It is crazy ||| I feel she is...most of these actor bring in their personality into their acts ||| Damn!! that is creepy. I havent experienced that before ||| I hope they move on! ||| I cant dwell in such. I profile people up before even getting close ||| i am so happy for you buddy. ||| thanks friends. Bye ||| oooh..my bad. I avoid controlling people and manipulative people ||| lol...You are now! and that is the brighter part ||| yeah..bye ||| It is terrible...I have never been a fan of divorce ||| I always believe it is workable ||| Yeah..that is what most people aint willing to do ||| Can you divorce? ||| I dont see myself doing it ||| yea..the institution should be well guarded ||| Nice talking with you. bye ||| My bad...what do you have to add? ||| People should know the effects of these on kids ||| Spot on!!!! ||| bye ||| The ISIS is a global threat ||| I feel the whole world power should stand up against them ||| Of course. That should be done. I mean, why protect the same pest harming and maiming you/ ||| They they will be at the receiving end... ||| I agree with that. What the world is expected to do is to prevent their spread ||| Exactly my point. ||| It is sad really. We trying to do all we can to protect the world yet all we get in return is blame. ||| Yea...i agree with that. hope we can exchange our bye ||| Same here...more arms for destruction ||| I would love that myself...bye ||| I hate everything about ISIS..i really hope they can be totally eliminated...You? ||| It is sad really... ||| It really is. I wish we can have more ways to control this though ||| Yea, we should totally protect our self from it. That is the only way we can intervene. ||| Of course..the attention will make them grow stronger ||| In as much as we playing the big brother role, I feel we should focus more on how to protect ourselves. ||| We should spread our self out too much..we do the little we can and other countries should take in those they can ||| Exactly.. ||| It does...I can be carefree at times though ||| bye ||| It really is...its sad ||| almost similar hurt...its like losing kids ||| I hope so....I just hope they have their home insured also ||| another twist...I pray that is not the case though ||| Yeah, you can get to pick a few things ||| My phone, certificates and a cloth ||| I have a ash cardigan my wife gave me as the first gift ||| None yet... ||| You? You've got any? ||| hahaha...alright. bye ||| it is very wicked and sad ||| Exactly. The locals can set up some committee though ||| There should... ||| It is inhumane. It is some form of entertainment for them ||| I blocked some of my friends that engaged in such. It is totally different if the killing os for survival ||| Its is human wickedness to the planet. Humans are the most selfish ||| WHat do you think can be done to protect those animals. They might go into extinction soon ||| Yeah. I feel proper education for the kids would help. But then, most kids copy their parents ||| You have a very valid point. ||| That is sad. Nice talking with you. bye ||| It is really sad...at such a tender age? ||| I really cant figure it out. I feel so terrible for the parent though ||| No they dont. Did you see anything of such nature? ||| Exactly. How do you think child motality can be reduced? ||| Yeah. That will be a great start ||| Well I feel its natural, when its bound to happen, no one can stop it. We have one of the best health institutions in the world IMO ||| I cant imagine losing a kid... ||| Have you ever lost someone close to you? ||| Hmmnnnn..that is true ||| I feel the parents should join a support group ||| Yea...it will really help a lot ||| be ||| bye"
p051,"I understand that the women broke a leash law, but the consequences was not deserved.  It seems like the man overreacted by shooting a dog for running up to him and should be held criminally liable.

p052,The feelings that I have regarding the article is that somethings happen for a reason and they are out of your control sometimes. I think what went wrong in that conflict can be resolved and all that is needed is clear cut communication so that both parties know where each other stands at the end of the day. I personally think that is the best option and that the article itself is something that is worth a read in my opinion.,"Hello ||| What did you think of the article ||| Tell me about it ||| Both.

p053,"There are a lot of troubled people in the world today. Every time I read an article or see a news story about another shooting, I get a little bit on edge. These kind of things happen too much these days. I long for the time when we were growing up when you didn't see this in the news every day. It's good that more people weren't hurt.","Every time I read about another shooting I get a bit on edge. ||| It doesn't have the same impact anymore, which is sad. ||| At least there weren't too many people hurt this time. ||| I wonder how he got his assault rifle. ||| It's not like you can just walk into Walmart and buy an assault rifle. ||| I live in the suburbs, so you don't really see that kind of thing here. ||| I've only really started seeing so many stories like this in the last few years probably because of social media. ||| When I was growing up this kind of things was only once every few years instead of few weeks. ||| I guess everything seems simpler and safer when you're little. ||| I wonder if he was trying to make a political statement because it happened near a polling place. ||| I think thats 10 turns each now.

p054,"This is a tragic and sad story about how some children can experience the foster care system. Shelton bounced from one home to another, getting into trouble along the way, before beginning a life of crime and going to prison as a young adult and then as an adult. Given the way he was raised, it is almost impossible to imagine an alternate ending. ||| Red squirrels in Britain are found to be carrying leprosy. Many of them are carrying strains of the skin disease that are the same as what infected human Europeans all the way back in medieval times. These same strains have been eradicated in the mainland of the UK for a number of centuries. It is a serious skin disease. ||| A number of Jewish Americans have been concerned about the possibility a rise in antisematic behavior following the election of President Donald Trump. Some extremists painted symbols of hate in prominent Jewish areas, leading some Jewish Americans to question whether the extremists' behavior was related to Trump's election. ||| Four people were killed in a train crash that happened in Spain's northwest region. The train's carriage had flipped on its side after hitting a bridge near the train tracks. Fifty more people were injured. It is a true tragedy for this community to suffer a horrific accident of this nature. I feel for the people of the area. ||| Food waste is becoming a rather large problem in America. A 2010 study found that one hundred and thirty three billion pounds of edible foods went uneaten in 2010. That is absolutely ridiculous. With as many starving homeless and poor people as are in this country it should not be that so much food is being wasted. ||| Jose Fernandez, a pitcher for the Miama Marlins baseball team, was killed in a tragic boating accident. He was only 24 years old when he and two others were found dead near the entrance of Miami Harbor. Coast Guard employees found his boat upside down and found the three victims lifeless nearby following this accident. ||| Adam is a South Korean man who was adopted by American parents at age 3. He lived until recently in Vancouver Washington with his family. He is now being deported back to South Korea and is currently detained in an immigration detention center while customs enforcement and immigration can make the necessary arrangements.

Adam stated that he had ended up on the radar of federal immigration officials after applying for a green card in 2012. ||| There were seventy three people killed in a horrific accident in Mozambique when a fuel tanker exploded. There were seventy three residents gathered around the tanker waiting to buy fuel from the driver when the explosion suddenly happened, killing seventy three and injuring one hundred and ten people. This was a tragedy. ||| There were at least ten people hurt after a rather large apartment complex in Arizona caught on fire. The fire was caught on video. The fire chief stated that it was a total loss and that the fire had been started following an unexplained explosion. It took the fire department crews close to ten minutes to get the fire under control. ||| Two US troops and twenty six Afghan civilians were killed and many others were injured following an airstrike that occurred early on Thursday while NATO and afghan forces were battling Taliban fighters in the northern Kunduz province. The capital had recently been overrun with insurgents last month from nearby areas. ||| The death of a former aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin was recently ruled accidental.

It sounds like they had a hard life in cuba ||| Im sure his life was quite different after beginning his baseball career ||| very sad. from the reading material he sounded like a great person ||| yes it sounds like he stayed true to himself ||| I dont know how the driver managed to hit the rocks at full speed. Youd have to see something like that coming ||| No not at all. A real tragedy for sure ||| One of the best. ||| You too, goodbye ||| What a story! ||| It sounds like the system failed him at an early age ||| For sure. Many fall  through the cracks and its so sad. ||| I know! What are the odds? ||| I'd say have more oversight of individual cases. So many children arent getting the attention on their cases that they need. Do you have any suggestions? ||| Absolutely. And also some sort of self sufficiency classes for those who are about to age out of the system ||| My school had them every week and I loved it. Learned a lot of life skills ||| Sewing, vehicle maintenance, budgeting, childcare, basic home repairs, tax basics, etc. ||| I think all schools should offer classes like that. Theyre very beneficial ||| I think its amazing how he turned his life around. A true inspiration ||| Great talking to you. Goodbye ||| Yes, such an unfortunate series of events. ||| And then to spend his entire life in America and be deported, what a tragedy. ||| I cant imagine being sent back to a country Ive never really lived in. It makes me feel terrible for him. ||| Yes for sure. It is good to see that this may not happen again in the future. Can you imagine how his adoptive family must have felt? ||| Of course. It just compounds the tragedy the child has already experienced. ||| I think in cases like this there should be some consideration given to the totality of circumstances that lead to the criminal activity. ||| That may be true but these are people's lives, how can we say that there isnt time to consider their situations? ||| I disagree. When we fail to consider individual citizens as their own unique person rather than a populus as a whole, it creates more problems. ||| There has to be a middle ground where the system works effectively but still considers the rights of individuals ||| You make a good point. I would be interested to know how his life in S Korea is going now. I do hope better than what hes had so far. ||| Goodbye ||| Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique. ||| Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel. ||| I have to wonder what, if any, safeguards they had in place to prevent such an event, or if its even something that could have been foreseen. ||| I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this. ||| Very much so. And i doubt there will be any type of mental health support for the survivors. ||| Absolutely. I would be terrified to ever do that again. And to think how distraught the families of the victims must be. ||| Events like this really make you ponder your own mortality. ||| There will certainly be lingering questions of why and whether it could have been prevented. Have you experienced any similar tragedies? ||| Completely unexpected for sure. ||| I have not, but I have family from Africa. How about you? ||| You too. Goodbye ||| Yes but also upsetting that ten were injured ||| Yes geting it under control in about ten minutes is impressive ||| They said that the fire was caused by an explosion but they dont know how the explosion happened. ||| Perhaps. Gas leaks can be quite scary ||| I hope nobodys homes were destroyed in the apartment complex fire. ||| Yes i hope the complex at least sets them up with some temporary housing while they rebuild ||| And often renters dont carry renters insurance so im not certain they will be reimbursed for their damaged belonginga ||| True.

I dont know if its even possible at this point. ||| I hope they can do so ||| It will take a lot of effort on both sides though ||| And the fighting has been going on so long now ||| I wish it could be resolved sonn ||| goodbye ||| Can you believe leporosy of all thjings is making a comeback in squirrels? ||| I know! Those poor little animals ||| It must be truly terrible for them ||| I wonder how effective that might be ||| Yeah I think that might help somewhat. ||| Im certain some animal rights groups would be interested if they even know about it. This is the first Im hearing of the issue ||| Probably so. I hope it does nto spread here too ||| I cant imagine the pain the animals must be in ||| I truly hope something can be done to combat the disease ||| Yes we can only hope so ||| nice talking with you. goodbye ||| What a tragedy! ||| Yes no doubt. And I feel terrible for the victims' families ||| I know, theyre regarded as being so safe and then somethig like the happens unexpectedly. ||| I would think that the tracks would be better maintained. But I guess you cant plan for every possible problem ||| I have not. Just subways for me. They scare me more than a train would. ||| Yes I think the underground aspect gives me a bit of claustrophobia. My city doesnt have subways so it isnt something Im accustomed to. ||| Since trains appear so safe, I would say the victims of this crash were not even expecting anything to go wrong. ||| Very much so. I hope they were able to work out whatever issues led to this crash. ||| It is a tragedy for sure ||| it was great chatting with you today ||| goodbye ||| I cannot begin to understand how this much food is wasted each year. ||| It really makes me want to do more to reduce waste ||| I think even a small effort on everyone's part would make some impact on overall waste ||| I think on a corporate level, there should be more donation of these unused foods, rather than them all going to waste. ||| That seems like a great idea ||| I wish that was an option where I live. ||| HOA nazis. They dont like the sight or smell of it. ||| Unfortunately where I am, almost all properties are in an HOA or the ghetto. I would like to move out of county and get some land and grow my own food, compost, all of that fun stuff. ||| Yeah that is a definite downside to it. ||| Only flowers. I do hope that the food waste problem can be resolved to some extent in the near future though. ||| You too. Goodbye ||| What a tragedy! ||| The circumstances do raise a number of questions about what may have really occurred ||| There seem to be a lot of issues in Russia that deserve a closer look ||| Yeah, it makes me suspicious of the official explanation as well ||| And we will probably never know the full story ||| Maybe pressure from the government? ||| So sad to live under that type of government ||| I hope for the family's sake they can get a real answer. Although I doubt it will happen ||| Very suspicious either way ||| Overall I think that level of government corruption is terrifying ||| It has been nice chatting with you. Goodbye."
p055,"It's sad that people anywhere are still threatened because of their beliefs. I don't understand why any religion is so set against other that they want to hurt, kill and threaten them. How does someone else's belief harm your own? I guess I just don't get why people get so fanatic about religion and ignore parts of the teachings about tolerance, peace and understanding. It seems wrong that people use religion as an excuse for violence. ||| The fact that we don't take care of our veterans is worse than sad. We have a duty to honor them and take care of them. I'm happy to see so many people speaking out and making issues with PTSD more easy to talk about. We can't keep ignoring these issues and pretending that we just can't do anything for our vets. We need to make sure we take more time to work with each vet and get them the help they not only need but deserve! ||| This is such a sad story. Cancer is so hard on everyone and even the same cancer experience makes it different from everyone else. And yet, there is so much the same about people that have to suffer through this disease. It takes such a toll  on them and everyone around them as you feel so helpless while battling this terrible illness. I am so proud of people that maintain such a positive outlook and fight so hard. ||| The killing of elephants for ivory just makes me so angry. I can't help but wonder if anyone is really taking the possible extinction of them seriously. While the poachers are a definite problem, I think we need to also be worried about those that are buying the ivory. If we remove the demand, perhaps that will go a long way to helping stop the killing. I think cracking down on both sides of this issue is the only way we will see real change. ||| This is such a sad story. To think these girls have been driven to take their own lives because of bullying is appalling. Why can't we seem to do more to stop this behavior and why do kids and even adults feel that bullying behavior is acceptable. We have to start punishing kids for this behavior, make them be accountable for their actions and take a strong stand that says we won't tolerate this kind of behavior any longer. ||| I can't believe that anyone let's this type of behavior continue. Who let's their children be basically sold into slavery and then what government and officials allows it to happen. It's sad, disgusting and disturbing that this is something that is allowed to go on. It says something about the state of the world that this is what we've come to and that we just let it continue on. People should do more to ensure this behavior doesn't continue. ||| It bothers me so much that we are polluting our oceans to begin with and then to see that we are harming even more animals because of it. It seems crazy that plastic floating in the ocean can be harming sea birds but it also does make some sense. Just more humans doing harm to things that we had no business messing with to begin with. I am so angered over this and upset to think of the damage our garbage is causing. ||| It's terrible that so many people all around the world seem to want to flee their home countries rather than do more to make them better. I understand fearing death and economy troubles but if everyone just left those countries the ones they flee to will just have similar problems. I can understand how Germany doesn't want to just accept anyone and yet at the same time can feel sorry for those that have legit claims and are just turned away because of where they are from. ||| I think it's always tragic when someone dies, but when that someone is a milestone type person it's even worse. How wonderful to be the first Chinese woman to be a fighter pilot and then how tragic to be killed in such a way. I have so much respect for trailblazers and it always seems like such a waste for them to be taken from us in such a seemingly meaningless manner. So proud of her accomplishments. ||| This is such a sad story. How can going to an amusement park turn into such a terrible ending. It doesn't even seem possible. I've been to Disneyland and to all sorts of fairs growing up and I can't even imagine that such a terrible thing could happen. You are having a great day, making memories and suddenly your life won't ever be the same again. How terrible. I feel for that family. I can't even believe that such a thing could happen. ||| After reading about this disaster I'm just heart broken. It's so sad to think that one incident can impact an entire area and impact so many people for so long. That river will never be the same and there is nothing anyone can do now but wait and hope that someday, things might be better. But now all those people are without water and work. Generations of fisherman can't fish there. Fish isn't safe to eat. It's beyond sad. ||| Earthquakes are such scary things. It's amazing how much damage can happen and leave you feeling so helpless. There is no warning and nothing you can do but hold on as the earth itself moves. Then to see people taking advantage of the disaster to steal is just sickening. Such a sad thing to see that people don't always come together but look to benefit from other's suffering. Disappointing and says something about the world we live in now. ||| This story was so sad. I wanted to know a bit more about Bindi, but hearing that she struggled for such a short time and wasn't able to survive was heartbreaking. It was nice to see the extremes people were willing to go to in order to try and save her but knowing that is necessary is tough to take. It brought tears to my eyes and made me want to cry just thinking about being in that situation. ||| It's issues like this that both upset and confuse me. I just can't understand how children and people in general can be pushed to suicide by what they read or are exposed to on the internet. Perhaps it's because I can't imagine harming myself that I don't understand the state that this people must be in. Suicide is such a tough situation and so hard to deal with. It makes me sad to think people target troubled souls and enjoy seeing the harm they do to themselves. ||| I'm so tired of all this violence. If a cop shoots someone suddenly it's acceptable to go around and commit violence or loot and steal. We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.","This article just makes it so clear how little tolerance there really is in the world. It's sad we claim we are all so much more civilized these days, but the truth is we still seem people are more different than the same. ||| I find it interesting that so many people still use religion as an excuse for violence and only focus on the most violent parts of the religion and ignore the preachings of tolerance and peace. ||| It is sad that there doesn't seem to be any way to help those people from the article. Even if they wanted to go back so much has been destoryed that you can understand why they'd want to stay away. ||| Until there is a change in the way extremists think and act, I can't see a way this will change. ||| I often wonder how a religion that millions can follow peacefully is allowed to be twisted by those same followers and used to do so much evil. Don't you think the islamic followers should do more to police the extremists? ||| I think so too. If religion is such an important aspect of their lives, why don't the leaders have more power to control the out of control elements of their religion? ||| I just don't understand a religion that allows for the harm of those that aren't looking to harm you. ||| I agree that killing is wrong. However, regarding this article it is nearly impossible to set religion aside as it is the reason the killings are happening. ||| I don't understand why they can't. If both sides have elements of tolerance built right into the religion who is to say it's right to set aside those elements? ||| I wish they would. I mean taking the article into consideration again, even if you forget the killing the damage done in the name of religion needs to be addressed. Both sides need to do more to remember peace, tolerance and acceptance is better than violence and hatred. ||| I do have hope. I mean on a person to person basis the idea of tolerance and peace seems so simple and easy. It just seems that when we take it to a global stage we start forgetting the meaning of those words. ||| I too always try to promote acceptance and understanding. Perhaps if we all keep trying things will start to improve. ||| In the long run I guess we are left with the same thing as always -- hope for the future. ||| I would like to think they would be. Religion is so tough to judge as people tend to interpret it for their own uses. ||| This is very true. The twisting of religion to use others to bring about your own desires is very sad. I think we've had a good discussion here. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, goodbye. ||| what did you think about this article ||| I agree... and it's sad they don't have the support from their country like they should ||| I used to work in the VA doing medical data entry... it's always so backed up and people just do the bare minimum to try and keep up with the demand ||| My bet is people had the same symptoms but were less vocal about them as times have changed. ||| I think that could play into it too, paretns coddle their kids more and such creating less \strong\"" adults"" ||| Or I just hope wars will lessen and lessen over 50 years and there is nothing/nobody fighting but that is high hope ||| Yes I think so... Unless something big happens ||| haha I hope that doens't happy ||| Haha I figured... But i mean who reallly knows! ||| For sure... it's been nice chatting. Bye ||| bye ||| The idea that we are still allowing so many endangered animals to be killed and especially an animal as gentle and amazing as an elephant is just heartbreaking. I feel so frustrated, angry and helpless over this situation. I do think it is time to crack down on those buying the ivory as strongly as those poaching. ||| There is no obvious simple solution and I think that is part of the problem. I think it's hindered by so many African countries that are poor and the amount of money made on the blackmarket for ivory just makes it difficult to stop. ||| Oh yes, that is nearly as difficult as the poachers I'm sure. But even beyond the buyers, those that are buying ivory items and maybe not realizing what that means is a big factor I think. If we educate more people about what having an ivory figurine means, perhaps that can be a start as well. ||| Oh exactly, it always comes down to the money. Stop them being able to make a profit and perhaps we can stop the senseless killing. ||| Yes corruption I'm sure is very huge. It has to take everyone being on the same page to make a difference. As the article stated having each country giving elephants different levels of protection shows that no one is seeing this issue in the same way. ||| I do think the west will have to step in. Unfortunately, it takes a major outrage before we seem to be able to get all the west willing to do more. ||| Well it's so easy to ignore it now. We don't like something on social media, we can just ignore those posting about it. Something has to be done to make it not so easy to ignore. ||| So very true. Who do we even believe anymore? Where can we turn to get information that we can believe in. ||| I totally agree. It seems news media are more like the old tabloids going for shock value and trying to get the most following and not worried about real news issues and trying to educate the people. Things going on in Africa are so far away, it's easy to let those kinds of issues slide in favor of the latest scandal to get ratings. ||| Awareness, education and meaningful discussions of what the loss elephants can mean to the world are definitely a key. ||| Unfortunately, I think I have to agree. Unless the poaching starts having an impact on our daily lives, I fear most will simply ignore it as something that doesn't matter. ||| Definitely. And the rangers that are putting their lives on the line to try and make a difference aren't being respected either. ||| Seems issues always boil down to the same things. More money needed. More education needed. More knowledge. More awareness. ||| I have to agree. I hope that by raising our own awarness with conversations like these we can start seeing some change. I've enjoyed this conversation and want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas. I've enjoyed our talk, goodbye. ||| Hello. It's beyond terrible. I can't even imagine going through something like that. I mean you're out to make lasting memories and instead lose your whole family. Terrible. ||| I know. I've grown up going to fairs every summer and been to Disneyland and other amusment parks and you just never imagine that things like that can happen. ||| It's funny because you hear now and then that something like this can happen. Yet whenever I'd go. It would never even cross my mind. I guess it's funny how we don't like to imagine that kind of terrible incident happening to us directly. ||| Oh, I know nothing is impossible. I just don't guess we like to imagine that they happen to us. ||| I'm sure they will be. I fear that is another problem with our society. We take every bad thing and want to see it as a way to make money. Not saying the company shouldn't be held accountable for their actions. But I wish we weren't always looking to make a buck off bad things and accidents. ||| I agree. Shoddy maintenance or failure to fix something due to expenses I'm sure probably was involved since there were many statements that the ride was having problems most of the day. I just think it's so sad that those people have to try and move forward after losing their loved ones in such a horrible way. ||| I also think its sad that so many people memories are ruined over this. I can't imagine all my happy summer fair memories and trips to amusement parks being tainted by something like this. ||| Me either. I also wonder why if the ride was having so many issues they didn't just shut it down. I'm not familiar with that park as I'm in the US but surely that wasn't the only ride. Why not just close it and then make sure its fixed for another day? ||| I'm sure greed did in fact have a part in it. I'd like to know more though. It's so easy to get caught up in the terrible accident part of the story and forget there are other sides to an issue. ||| Thanks for the chat. I enjoyed talking with you. bye ||| I think it's so terrible and horribly sad. Just another reminder of the damage we are continuing to do to the environment and the earth. ||| I can understanding needing and wanting money and doing things you don't like to get it. But I can't imagine getting money in such a way that I'd hurt so many other people in the process and ruin an entire river. I can't imagine being that kind of person. ||| I don't know if they even really think about other people at all. I mean, I feel that someone so focused on their own wealth above all else doesn't even take the time to consider other people in their plans at all. I don't think they even care as long as they are obtaining their goals. ||| No we can't. I don't think it really even matters what kind of mine it was. There isn't anything in the earth worth damaging an entire river and disrupting so many people's lives. ||| Well altneratives really depend on what type of mine it was. Basically for coal stop using fossils fuels. We have the ability to use wind, solar and water and we need to focus more on that. For minerals and gold and such, we need to figure out new manufacturing processes or start limiting the desire for those types of things so that mining isn't worth it. ||| That would be a nice thought. It's going to take some major changes from everyone on earth to make a difference. I hope that we wake up to that and start now. It can't be done overnight and we need to start somewhere. ||| I am afraid that for a lot of things you might be right. I'd hope we could make the change because it's the right thing to do. However, I fear that for a lot of things it's going to come down to we have no other choice. Sad to think, but people don't often change unless forced to. ||| I'd like to hope that we'd learn from our mistakes, but it seems we only learn the lesson for so long and then we backslide. I think it's not even so much fearing the change as the fact that so many people fear for their money and industry that makes money now are things we need to move away from. ||| I think it would be if it was a true free market system. But too often we say it's free market and yet we bail out companies because they are \too big to fail\"" but in a true free market if you fail you fail."" ||| Thanks for chatting. goodbye ||| Earthquakes are so scary. I'm from California and I know how tough they can be to deal with. But to hear of people stealing from those that suffered an earthquake is sickening. ||| Yeah seems like such a shame. People should be coming together not trying to benefit off the suffering of others. ||| Exactly. Earthquakes are devastating and so scary because there is so little you can do about them. Then you need to have people support you not steal from you. ||| Yeah, imagine having the world move under you and then when you're struggling to see what you have left, who is okay. Someone comes along and wants to steal your stuff. Terrible. ||| Talk about being violated twice. Suffer the disaster than rather than getting help the people in your community want to take what little might have survived the quake. Crazy. ||| I'm not sure there is anything. Other than worse punishments for those caught stealing and looting. But it's so hard to prove that when the world around you is in such chaos. I mean the police have other things to focus on at that time. ||| You'd like to think so. I'd like to believe people would just be kinder and nicer to one another. However, it seems like people are so much out for themselves and not worrying about others. It's hard to say if things can be brought into balance. ||| You'd think there would be. However, people are so self centered right now. Everyone feels that they are owed things and it's about their needs and not necessarily about the greater good. ||| It is sad. I mean at such a time when it's like the world is against you with a quake, you'd think people would see a bigger picture, but it seems they don't anymore. ||| It does seem so. I think social media makes us see people different now. We don't see \people\"" and we have less human interaction now. I think we just don't feel we connect like we used to anymore."" ||| Thanks for the chat. goodbye ||| I love animals. I was just heartbroken to hear that sad story. ||| Yeah, I wanted to know more as well. I think from what they said she was an orphaned rhino and I guess the place they took her didn't have a lot of support in place and she needed a lot of help is sounded like. I definitely wanted to know more details. ||| Yes, that was part of what made it so heartbreaking. They were obviously very invested in doing all they could for her. I wish I knew if that was some sanctuary or organization that is trying to help rhinos so that money could be raised to improve conditions so that perhaps they could save more babies. ||| I'm sure it does. Both wounded and abandoned. I just felt like I was getting only one tiny piece and I wanted to know so much more. ||| I've grown up around animals all my life. Horses, cows, chickens, ducks, dogs, cats, goats, pigs. Pretty much you name it and I've had a hand in raising it while growing up. I currently have two dogs of my own. Any animal suffering story really hits me hard. I'm a huge animal lover. ||| I totally do. They have just as much right to life and be protected as humans. We can both share this planet and by taking care of animals we do our part to keep the balance in nature. ||| I couldn't agree more. My dogs are part of my family. I can't imagine treating animals with less respect than another human, as you say they are often more deserving of compassion than some people. Even those animals we raised for food, we treated them with care and respect. That's how it should be. Do onto others applies to animals the same as people in my mind. ||| I would love to foster, but I get so attached so easily I'd never want to give them up. Ours are spoiled as well, they run the house more than we do. I have a yellow lab and a lab/german shorthair mix. ||| Yes, even knowing that in the end I'm giving another family a chance to have that special relationship with a dog. Bringing all that love into a new family would be wonderful but still so hard. I'm so glad there are people like you that can give that to new families and animals, it's such a rewarding and amazing thing. ||| I had a nice time chatting with you as well. goodbye ||| I can't even imagine how someone like that or multiple someone's like that can even exist. I am angered and saddened that these troubled kids are targeted in such a way. ||| Exactly. Who enjoys seeing such misery inflicted on others? I can't even begin to imagine how someone like that can do something like this. It's clear that Russia has a problem and then to see someone doing something like encouraging more deaths. It's sickening. ||| I know. I just can't understand the mindset of people that find this enjoyable or acceptable. You'd like to believe that these troubled kids could go online to find the help they need that they can't or aren't getting at home. Intead, they are used as a sick game to disgusting people. Unreal. ||| I really don't know. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how someone must think to do this. It's like bullying. They said it fed their egos? Who enjoys knowing they hurt other people? ||| Yeah, it'd say they are. It's crazy that someone would relish doing this kind of thing. How does someone even think that this is something appealing to them? How does it even get started. I just don't know why or what you can do to stop something like this. ||| It is. I don't want to start down a censorship slope, but you can see why the idea has merit. If you can't stop people from using the internet to harm others, what choice do you have? I'd like to believe parents or schools or someone could step in to help these troubled kids and lead them away from the internet that is causing them more harm than good. ||| I wish I knew. That is why this is continuing I suppose. And the fact that people don't like to talk about suicide, as if it's a dirty secret. Hopefully, more talk can lead to more people being aware online and doing more to keep shutting sites down. ||| Have more warnings about the dangers. Try to find what it is that lures kids to these sights and try and use those same tactics to lead them to locations of help rather than these nasty suicide cults or whatever they are. ||| Yes, do more than shut the sites down. Track the people that are putting them up and doing more to punish their behavior. ||| It's been a pleasure talking with you too. goodbye ||| I was so surprised to learn of yet another way our plastic is harming the environment. What did you think of this study on plastic causing harm to sea birds? ||| No, I knew plastic was an issue. I just didn't realize that it was this particular issue. Amazing to think that plastic is emitting a scent that is causing birds to eat it. Crazy, amazing and weird how nature works. ||| Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic. ||| Yeah, I'm amazed at some of the ideas that have been suggested and even put into use. The problem is there is so much ocean and trash already out there and so few people working to clean it up. ||| I don't know what method would be best. I figure any method that starts the process is a good one. I do know there are large masses of plastic that have been forming out in the ocean and it seems to me finding ways to gather those large groups would be a good start. ||| Oh yeah? I figure any step is a step in the right direction. I'm pleased to see anyone making any changes that will hopefully continue to grow and make a difference. I'm tired of us doing so much damage to the environment and the animals of this planet. They deserve the right to life as well. ||| I agree we need to do more. So what was the simple solution? ||| Yes, a great idea and a good way to begin to try and keep more plastic out of our water systems. If everyone did one simple thing perhaps we could be saving our sea life and making the environment better. Proud to see steps taken to make such a difference. ||| I believe we need to stop using so many plastic products. Recycle more and make sure that it is being recycled and not just dumped somewhere later. It will take a lifestyle change to do more to make sure that we reduce the need for plastaic. ||| I don't know. I think there is a movement slow though it may be to reduce plastic use. I hope that it continues. I've enjoyed our chat today. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. goodybe ||| bye ||| I find myself on the fence about this article. While I feel sympathy for those fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries, I also understand Germany not wanting to just open it's doors to everyone. Very much like situations we're facing here in the US at this time. What are your thoughts on the situation? ||| It does seem so. I find it interesting that Germany makes decisions based on where the people are coming from as well. We hear so often how the US is the only country being selective or not wanting too many refugees but everyone is facing similar situations. ||| Perhaps. I think the trouble is there are just too many for any country to take them all. Every story is troubling, but wouldn't it be better to focus on improving conditions in those countries rather than letting everyone leave and overburden other countries? ||| I believe Germany has to do what it can to protect itself first, otherwise how can it help anyone? I feel bad for some of the people talked about in the article, but I can understand why Germany has had to draw some hard lines. ||| I don't agree that the US has done little for immigrants or anyone else. We can't be the world police. We have our own issues and our own borders are overwhelmed by those attempting to flee Central and South America. I think it is a world problem that the world needs to work on to do better. Helping the war torn countries as a whole. The burden shouldn't fall on any one country. ||| I don't know much about how Canada handles immigration. I do think the problem isn't about immigration though but why the people are leaving their home countries. I feel that efforts need to be made to solve the problems in the countries people are fleeing to help a larger number of people and reduce the burden on other countries like in Germany that are often overwhelmed by those seeking a safer place to live. ||| I agree. The people highlighted in the story seem to have a true need to find safety somewhere else. Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed. ||| I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem. ||| Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made. ||| I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution. Thanks for sharing your thoughts today. goodbye ||| It is very much. I am afraid we're going to keep seeing it. However, I feel we are only getting half the story and we're only making national headlines about cops shooting people and not people shooting cops. ||| I totally agree. We tend to see the media picking and choosing what they focus on. We don't even get a fair representation of happenings. Instead, we get a skewed view to press a political hot button and not giving a fair understanding of the incidents. ||| I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas. ||| I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves. ||| I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media. ||| Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way. ||| It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did. ||| Exactly! Instead of letting them learn when they're young and the disappointments are more minor that they can survive not always getting what they want. We let them grow up thinking everything should go their way. Then suddenly, they don't get into the college they want or get the job they want and they can't deal with it. ||| Was great chatting with you as well. Enjoy your day. goodbye"
p056,"I was saddened by the content in the article. I do think PTSD is real and is a serious issue. I can't even imagine what those soldiers have to go through, and I hope that my loved ones never find out. I think it's understandable that adjusting back would be difficult. I really think we need to do better taking care of our troops... even in the beginning. Do we really need them? Are we putting their interests at heart, or just our political ones? ||| I had never considered the zoos in countries like Venezuela. I'm concerned that it seems like they're being fined and punished for their predicament. I think other zoos throughout the world should step up and try to rescue the animals, or at the very least, preserve them for a scientific purpose and euthanize them humanely. Those that are endangered should be removed. It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints. ||| I'm curious why the singer was labeled controversial. I guess only the statement that was made about security. I remember the event in this article happening because I like the band, and was familiar with them, and it could have been me at the show. All of those people were innocent and had no idea what was going on, didn't ask for it, etc. Hearing the stories was really traumatizing. I can't even imagine. I'm glad that everyone is able to overcome.","its tought to have PTSD ||| yes my cousin is a vet ||| yes they do ||| No I stay pretty calml ||| I think we need to spend more for veterans mental health ||| yes we treat our veterans terribly speaks alot about our country ||| the illegals ||| why would that happen ||| thats terrible ||| yes maybe one day artificial intelligence will turn us to cyborgs ||| yes skynet will become self aware ||| half man half amazing it was nice talking to you goodbye ||| I had never considered the zoo animals in countries like Venezuela. How sad. ||| I was kind of concerned when it started talking about zoo owners being fined or punished. It's not really *their* fault. ||| I thought that embalming/preserving some of the animals was a valid idea, for science, but only if absolutely necessary and only if they were euthanized humanely. ||| Definitely. Do you? ||| That's interesting! I do; a dog and a cat. ||| Yes, thankfully, haha. And the Great Dane that I babysit gets along relatively well, also. ||| He's 50-60 lbs, so mid-range? He's a catahoula. ||| I get a lot of funny looks when i mention his breed, sometimes! He is very handsome. ||| No, our local animal shelter, actually. The family was being relocated overseas and the base in the other location didn't allow dogs. They released him to the shelter so that his new home would be checked out and verified safe beforehand. We did luck out! ||| hahah! those rabbits are tricky! ||| I'm surprised the dog got to the final test, but I guess it's a good thing a rabbit came by ||| could have been dangerous! but I'm sure he's a lovely pet ||| precious! ||| Do you have pets yourself? And did your degree focus on specific species? ||| interesting! I almost went into equine studies. instead I got my AKC training certificate and an elementary education degree lol ||| I think we've hit our 15, but it was a fun chat with you! ||| bye! ||| I remember hearing about this event when it happened. ||| I remember thinking that could have been me, because that's the type of show that I'd go see. ||| Exactly. It wasn't politically directed at the band or venue or concertgoers. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Scary. ||| I'm not sure what a good response could be, but I think it was handled appropriately. ||| I hadn't heard the statement from the lead singer about security. Until that came up in the article, I didn't understand why he was \controversial\"""" ||| yeah, according to the article anyway. I didn't remember hearing that anywhere before. ||| It did say that him being not allowed at the venue wasn't substantiated/proven. ||| I'm not sure where the article came from, I didn't pay attention. ||| The other band that played at the memorial was Sting, right? ||| yeah the first one since the tragedy. I was surprised to hear he was still playing venues. ||| I didn't see a correlation with Eagles of Death Metal, though. Two entirely different genres. ||| thanks. it was nice. bye!"
p057,"The article brought up many good points about how Americans see refugees and asylum seekers, as well as the internal conflict we battle when we imagine them taking shelter here. Most Americans are empathetic when we hear stories or see images however when the moment for us to do anything come along we don't find the nerve to act. The mock home evacuation was very interesting however it cannot fully convey the actual feeling people feel when their lives are ripped from them. It will take something different to move people to the point where they realize these people are legitimately fighting for their lives.  ||| The man losing his wife and two children in the accident is very terrible and I feel for him dearly, as well as the ones who have lost their lives. It's very crazy how much danger we are in on the road and we do not realize it. In an instant many lives can be lost just because someone made a mistake or a bad choice and there is not ability to take it back. I wish there was a way we could make driving much safer as many lives are lost each day this way. ||| There was a fire at a house in NW Washington D.C. which isn't very far from where I live in Alexandria, VA. The fire caused the people to be evacuated living in the home and two of the family's cats were also killed in the fire. This is surprising because I thought cats are pretty good at escaping when things go bad. ","I was wondering what exactly we could do for them? ||| Essentially thats like a band aid isn't it? This problem has to be attacked at the source ||| I thought the mock home evacuation thing they did was pointless also. You can really pretend you are a refugee while you are in the safety of America ||| Also Ive notice the places the article mentioned like Somalia and Afghanistan have been war torn for the last decade ||| So if these regions will always be like this, and asylum seekers are growing each year, there definitely should be a different conversation besides just taking them ins ||| Agree. It was nice talking with you. goodbye ||| I felt the same way. I wonder if he will ever recover. ||| Do you think the other driver in the golf was street racing? It seemed like they were assuming he was ||| Yeah I guess I am always wondering about how situations like these can be avoided. ||| Yeah for everyone to die in both cars, the other car must have been going extremely fast. It just sucks that you can be like the Mother in this case, make no mistakes and still die. ||| I believe they all died. The mother the two younger children and the teenager. The other two definitely died in the VW. Sure I guess You could die in an accident going 60 mph. However I've been in one of those and walked away without a scratch. I dont think that could have been the case in this one ||| Youre right actually Two people out of the five in the van survived, which is everyone except his wife and two children. That's so horrible. I think head on collisions are worse also because the cars are moving in the opposite direction which increasing the impact. ||| I think the Husband felt guilty, maybe that he wasn't there or wasn't the one driving. I don't think the survivors felt guilty, probably just lucky that they were in the right seat. ||| Would you feel guilty though? Would you ask why them and not you? ||| Yeah I could see that. I would just be depressed and feel so fragile because I just saw two people die and the only difference was probably a feet or two between us. ||| That is a good quote and it was nice talking to you. goodbye ||| Yeah I felt the same way. I was actually surprised the cats didn't escape, aren't they usually good at getting out of disasters? ||| Yeah, NW D.C. is actually really lose to where I live, I wonder if its because a lot of these homes are really old and not up to code. ||| Yeah, thats probably the worst feeling too. Seeing your house burned and not knowing where you are going to sleep that night. ||| Yeah there is something really terrible about something as innocent as cats and dogs dying in a tragic fire. ||| Yeah I am not really a cat person but the idea of any animal being trapped in a burning house makes me pretty emotional. ||| Absolute worst way to die. My cousins have cats and there are so fearful of everything and always trying to escape, that why I was so confused that they didn't get out ||| Yeah so that was what I was thinking. If they didnt get out it means that they absolutely couldn't. Which makes this even sadder ||| They didnt mention insurance either. I hope they had good insurance and fire insurance is probably needed here also right? ||| Yeah not to mention that area is right after San Francisco and New York for the most expensive homes in the country. Big ouch there ||| Yeah they should probably look into goFundme or something simiar. Anyway it was nice talking to you. goodbye"
p058,"Hey man, this is crazy. I had no idea air pollution causes this much damage to us. Did you know in India it kills almost half a million people per year? That is absolutely insane. Something has to be done about this pollution. I wonder what it is in America? It's probably even worse here than it is there. Some places have real bad air quality. ||| Hey, so polar bears are being killed in mass. even though they are protected, they are still being killed off. why is it that humans do this so much? We have caused so many species to go extinct, will polar bears be next? I feel like this is just what we humans do. We cause the death and destruction of other species of animals and our own planet. ||| there are so many problems over there. syria is a war zone and will probably never recover. terrorism has destroyed that wonderful country. so many people are forced to flee for their lives. what can be done about it though? not much really. too much pain and suffering in the area. i wish them all well. ||| so some government people killed a wolf. I feel like most people won't really care about this story too much. im sure this kind of thing happens on a regular basis. I didn't even know there were protected wolves out there. Are they near extinction? Who knows. I know if I was stranded in the wild I wouldn't be upset that a wolf was killed. ||| i feel like our countries immigration policies are ridiculous. how can you possibly deport someone who has lived her his whole life basically? That just doesn't seem right. We really need to rethink the way we do things in this country. this just isn't fair to anyone to be honest. I'm sure his family is upset. ||| im so sick of seeing articles that are so negative. it's like every news article i see or story from the media is either native, bashing someone or someone being killed. why is it so hard to find positive information in news these days. i feel like i dont even want to look at the news anymore. its so depressing. ||| it's crazy how elephant poaching is still a thing. Nearly 1/3 of all elephants have been poached just because of the ivory. I cannot believe this is still going on. There needs to be more done to stop this. They are gonna end up causing these elephants to go extinct and then what? For some ivory? This makes no sense at all. ||| it's crazy how islamic terrorism is still a thing. I mean they are just kidnapping people and using them as shields. I cannot believe this is still going on. There needs to be more done to stop this. This war seems like it will never end. What can be done about it? Who knows at this point. This makes no sense at all. ||| People are suffering in the middle east. I wonder if there will ever be peace over there. I feel like the war is never ending. It just keeps going and going. If it's not al qaeda its ISIS or the taliban. When will it end? Is the war actually making anyones lives better? Or is it just making everything worse for everyone? ||| i cant believe stuff like this is going on. I mean you would think our society would be better by now. I feel like we as a society are getting worse in some ways, although in others we are improving, but still. What can be done? How can we improve? This is just par for the course at this point. I'm not even sure what to say about it.","It really is ridiculous. But what more can be done? It's been banned in multiple countries. I've even heard of groups of people who arm themselves and go out to personally stop poachers, and yet it still continues. I'm not sure what else could be done to stop this from happening. ||| I think you are right about cracking down on the buyers. Maybe trying to stop the poachers is a losing effort, but going after the buyers may have an impact. But these criminal blackmarkets are probably very difficult to shut down. ||| I'm sure that would go a long way. It's at least something that could be done that may have an impact. As we've seen from the drug trade, stopping illegal items from being sold is almost impossible. I'm sure there's levels of corruption involved as well. There's so much money to be made I bet a lot of these officials are cashing in and turning a blind eye as well. ||| And when it's the officials who are getting paid, the ones who are supposed to be stopping this, it makes it that much harder. ||| I think if the west took more of an interest in this things could get done. Poaching still a problem? Cut the aid given to the country. If they make it a priority things will change. ||| You're right. Not to mention with all the political nonsense going on right now, I think people are being overwhelmed with problems and issues and just kind of ignore it all. ||| Yeah, I also think it's because people don't know what to trust anymore. Can we really say the news sources are trustworthy? Officials are lying, news commentators are biased, social media is full of nonsense, who wants to deal with that? ||| That's the question. The news media seems more like propaganda to me these days. Almost like school children hurling insults back and forth. So something like the illegal ivory trade would definitely get pushed to the bottom of the news worthy list. ||| Yeah. I think awareness is key. Increase awareness and maybe it will effect change. I mean, I wasn't aware poaching was this bad of a problem until reading this article. ||| With all the problems occurring worldwide I don't have much faith in anything stopping poaching honestly. ||| Yeah, it really is unfortunate. Those elephants don't deserve that, and I'm sure it's frustrating to the rangers trying to stop it. People just don't care anymore unless it's right smack dab in their face. ||| Yeah I remember the article said those rangers were being shot at on sight by the poachers. That's madness. Seems like it would be taken more seriously if it's that dangerous out there. ||| Yeah, I'm sure funding is an issue as well. Hiring more rangers, or even bringing in some kind of military presence probably isn't an option. ||| Yeah, and when those things are lacking, everything just gets worse and worse. ||| I enjoyed it as well, goodbye. ||| This article was very eye opening. I had no idea air pollution killed so many people. ||| Over half a million people die in India from bad air quality? That's insane, I wonder what can be done about it. ||| Yeah, I didn't know lung cancer was the second deadliest form of cancer either. ||| Yeah, I grew up in a smoking household. Secondhand smoke does suck, are you a smoker? ||| Good friend of mine has been smoking his whole life and switched over to E cigs, he says it's better. I don't know much about them though. ||| I wish that article talked about the effect of bad air pollution on people without lung cancer in california ||| yeah, I feel like the article in general was lacking, interesting content but it definitely needed more info ||| I wonder if that was the intent, just to give us a taste and motivation to do further research on our own. ||| I feel like most people won't care about air pollution until it gets so bad they can hardly breathe, then maybe things will change. ||| Yep, that seems to be how it's been going with everything else. Our attention spans are so short it seems like no one can really be bothered with anything unless its a major issue that lasts a while and is right in our face. ||| That's a good point. I do think we could all be more proactive about positive change though. There's got to be a way to make it happen. Education is certainly one area that could improve. ||| After that though, how can we motivate action? It's like protesting, once an issue has been made known, and awareness has increased, I wonder what can be done to cause people to demand action, instead of just forgetting about it or moving on to the next topic ||| Yeah, also there's so many issues in our society that need addressing i think it's hard for people to focus on any one problem. ||| I agree, well it was nice having this chat with you, I really enjoyed it. goodbye ||| I wish this article gave more information on the subject. ||| I guess I'm not very surprised. Seems like endangered species are getting wiped out all over the world. I just saw another article about elephants in africa being killed for their ivory. ||| I'm not very hopeful it will. It's like no one really cares at all about these issues. As long as profits are to be made anyway. ||| That article was lacking so much information. Would be nice to know what steps they are taking to try to protect the bears. I think a video was supposed to be included. ||| I'm not really sure. I mean, if people have legitimate reasons for being there and are in danger of being attacked by a polar bear, they should have the right to defend themselves. But maybe restricting access to the places where these bears are would work? I'm not really sure. ||| Well, care in the sense that they are motivated to effect change. The news media certainly isn't pushing these stories to the top. I'm sure people care enough to sign a petition or something along those lines, but would they even donate money? Who knows. What do you think about what's being done so far? ||| It's certainly possible. At least the warming of the climate effecting polar bears in general, probably not the issue of visitors killing them. You are right the government should be doing more. But that all goes back to people not caring. Listen to any politician speak, they won't say anything about protecting any endangered animals, it's all health care, economy, illegal immigration etc ||| Yeah that certainly is possible. Raising awareness is one area. I didn't know  there were problems with the polar bears in Norway until reading this article. More attention needs to be on these issues. Although, there's so many animals being threatened, do you think we run the risk of flooding people with too much and people being overwhelmed and just ignoring it all? ||| Petitions, donation drives, contacting politicians and informing them these are issues you care about. I suppose all of those could help. I'm not sure it's enough though. ||| Yeah I'm sure that would convince some, but in order for real change, it would require a large number of people to make this an important issue for them. How many people are gonna take off work to go to the zoo lol. ||| If I'm being honest, I don't think I would. In fact, I doubt I'd even notice if it did happen. I've never seen one person, and I don't think they would have any impact on my life. I do believe they should be saved, but in terms of what I would be willing to do to help? Probably not much. ||| What could I do? I could donate money. What else could one person do to have a meaningful impact on polar bears in Norway? Then there's the elephants in Africa, the dolphins are also being killed off in mass, etc etc etc ||| Well, not so much overwhelmed, but just that there isn't anything more than just donating money I could realistically do. Unless I wanted to travel to Norway and volunteer with the organization that is tasked with protecting the bears. Which isn't realistic for me. ||| That's the thing, I can't really think of any. ||| Do you have any ideas? ||| Yeah, I don't think people would agree with more taxes anyway. ||| Yeah, that could be a good way to raise awareness at least. Well, I enjoyed this conversation with you. goodbye ||| I think it's horrific, using people as human shields is crazy. ||| I wonder what can be done about this, I mean, there's already a war being fought. What else can be done. ||| I wish the article mentioned when this apparently took place. It didn't even say when the article was written. ||| Can you imagine being forced out of your home and made to be someones shield in case they get shot at? Unbelievable. ||| Yeah. It said 5000 people had been kidnapped. ||| yeah it's horrible. things like this probably happen on the regular over there too. ||| I think if i were there my main priority would be to leave that country by any means necessary. ||| yeah its definitely hard to escape that ||| im honestly not very optimistic about that. i think that place will be a war zone for a long time ||| you too, goodbye ||| Yeah, I feel like I've been desensitized to what's going on over there. The war has been going on for so long. ||| Yeah, I don't see a solution at all. After all these years of war, it's still hell over there. ||| It shouldn't all be on the USA. Helping those people should be a global responsibility. I think helping them to take back their land and make it safe over there for them would be the best option. ||| I've heard of a few countries taking some in, but it usually causes crime rates to sky rocket. There's just no good solution. ||| Nothing. There are people suffering in every country, every city. I mean, you ever hear about how bad things are in north korea? No one dares tackle that problem because of how big of a mess it would cause. What can we do? ||| Yeah. These articles leave me with an almost hopeless or helpless feeling. Like I know what's going on, but because there's nothing to be done about it, I almost wish I didn't know. ||| I really would like to see more positive news coming out of that area. Does it all have to be so negative? ||| Yeah anytime I hear anything about Afghanistan it's always someone was killed or something bombed, or something else to do with terrorism. I can't remember the last positive thing I've heard about in that area. ||| Yeah me either. It really puts things into perspective. No matter how bad things are in the USA, it's no where near as bad as it is over there. ||| ok, nice talking to you, goodbye ||| I wonder if this war will ever end, doesn't seem like it's anywhere close to ending any time soon. ||| Can you imagine getting a msg saying to leave in 24 hours or be bombed? Crazy. ||| Can't blame them for wanting to leave and move to another country either. ||| I feel like the US should just stay out of this conflict, I don't know if the so called moderate rebels are any better than assads regime ||| It always seems like the US has to get involved in every other countries conflicts. Seems like it never ends. ||| what's your stance on taking in refugees from these war torn countries? ||| I think that would be fair. I think every country needs to step up and help out in any way they can. ||| from what i have read about france and germany, taking in refugees has caused their crime rates to skyrocket ||| yeah, and any kind of infrastructure and programs to help them would cost quite a bit, i dont think many countries are willing to spend on that. ||| oh definitely, not to mention news media are almost covering up some of the crimes committed by refugees, the average population has no idea who to trust. ||| Thanks for the conversation. goodbye ||| I thought it was interesting, I had a hard time connecting with it though. What about you? What did you think? ||| Oh yeah? In what way? ||| Hmm, yeah I see what you mean, articles like this just leave me feeling like there isn't much that can be done ||| Yeah, it just doesn't seem like it will ever really happen. ||| it could be, but who really knows ||| i think it might help, but will that overcome human nature? I mean, honestly, I just don't know. what do you think? ||| it's a shame we cant just get along and work together, need to be separated like rowdy children on the playground ||| yeah thats true, gotta do what you gotta do ||| yeah i agree, its like reading articles like this just brings me down, i wonder if thats why things like this fly under the radar as people tune it out because of so much negativity in the world ||| yeah and its causing all kinds of problems, people would rather just tune it out and act like nothing is happening, ignorance is bliss i suppose ||| nice talking to you too, goodbye ||| What did you think about the article? ||| neither was i, they seem to be doing a lot too, killing over 3 million wildlife animals in a year ||| i wonder what punishment if any would they receive for killing it ||| yeah, i feel like the article makes it out to be a bigger deal than it really is ||| i also wonder how close that wolf was to populated areas, maybe it was killed for safety reasons ||| that makes sense, im sure they had a good reason for killing it ||| yeah, i feel like the article was trying to make this out to be some great injustice but it missed its mark. ||| oh absolutely, all generated to get clicks for advertising, even AI generated youtube videos are becoming popular. ||| not really, often times using computer generated voice and clips that are somewhat related but mashed together. ||| i feel like i've been so desensitized to bad news it's hard to really react to anything anymore, I can't remember the last time Ive seen positive news in the media. ||| you too, goodbye ||| what did you think about the article? ||| i know right? being deported when you spend your whole life in a country is rough ||| i believe he was sent to south korea, but yeah, still doesn't make it any better ||| yeah definitely, its horrible. i mean i get we need an immigration policy, but to deport a guy because he had a few problems with the law when he's been here his whole life is a bit much ||| i wish the article spoke more on his plans once he gets to south korea. like what does he plan to do there. ||| yeah i imagine so. i dont remember if the article said anything about an appeals process or something he could do to get it overturned. ||| im sure something would be done if it got enough media attention ||| well you never know, im sure some people would definitely think he should be deported, especially after looking at his criminal history. ||| yeah you're right. and then to be abandoned by the only country he's ever known, leaving behind his pregnant wife and kids. thats just crazy ||| yeah, i feel like it's almost rare to see some positive news in the media these days ||| i mostly just tune it all out now a days. well, thanks for chatting. goodbye ||| what do you think about the article? ||| same, im so tired of seeing articles about people being killed or other negative content, i feel like the media just wants to make everyone depressed. ||| i dont want to get all conspiracy theorist or anything but it feels like this is being done on purpose to maybe get people to tune out or stop caring altogether ||| oh definitely, its just another story, tomorrow will have another murder or something similar, its a shame how desensitized we've become ||| definitely, i could see life in prison, maybe even the death penalty because of how brutal the attack was ||| its really hard to imagine. some people just have no regard for human life. i mean they stabbed him 15 times, partially burned him and tried to bury him i mean what the hell. ||| it'll be interesting to see what happens, seeing as how they don't know which one killed the guy, and they havent been charged with murder yet ||| i would bet it does, theres even criminals who flaunt their criminal activity on social media for bragging rights, people looking for attention, and the fame of being talked about on the news and such ||| some believe its a mental health problem, that maybe all these drugs doctors are pumping people up with may have side effects causing this type of behavior ||| yeah its scary to be honest. seems like at least once a month theres another mass shooting, or something going on. it really is a shame ||| i agree, you too, goodbye"
p059,,"Yeah, I thought it was very troubling because of the number of times she went for help, and she was always just turned away, essentially. ||| That's really sad to hear that it took that long. I'm not surprised at all, but it's ridiculous that mental health issues aren't treated as seriously as other medical issues since they can be just as fatal. ||| Yeah, if you can't get help from doctors, who can you get help from? I definitely have heard stories like this before though, since mental health care is so overstressed and understaffed, people who aren't considered 'in immediate danger' just get sent home. ||| Right, because I imagine she felt hopeless or unimportant. I guess the question is how things can be improved in the mental health care system? ||| Yeah, I think it would take a generational change, like starting with education in schools about mental health care and that it's just like any other illness that needs to be respected and understood. ||| I'm sorry that happened to you. It's so ignorant. We definitely need education campaigns and PSAs to try and educate people. ||| Yeah I feel like that whole system needs a massive overhaul. Like that's their government system so they need to be extra accountable over there. ||| Yeah, she took one of the worst ways out. She must have been desperate. ||| I feel like it probably happens a lot so they might be numb to it. ||| It's something that needs to be investigated by people above them though, like by politicians etc, they need new directives to properly handle things. ||| I wonder if in that particular case, in the UK, if it will help that it was someone involved with the news media. Like it might make the media pay more attention to it and they'll get more pressure because of that. ||| Yep, I feel like that's typical though, and we just need to work with it. ||| Yeah. If the media puts pressure, that might actually cause some change, even if it's sad that that is what it takes. It's better than nothing. Could be the start of a good education campaign. ||| For sure. Have a good rest of your day. :) ||| goodbye ||| I thought the article was very thought provoking and in line with things I felt already, that empathy is severely lacking in society in general. People are too dismissive of those suffering and assume they made choices to put themselves in that situation. ||| I do wonder how well it would work for the people who need it most, like how easy it would be for them to compartmentalize that it's not real or not. Or whether people like that would even try scenarios, outside of school or some place where they had to. ||| Yeah for sure. I think schools would probably be the best place to start, or continue anyway, since kids are less set in their ways ||| Right. I think additional media campaigns as well that show the human face of conflicts, natural disasters etc, as well are important, so that people can't hide away from it as much ||| I think a lot of it is just ignorance or how easy it is to ignore stuff rather than willful maliciousness but I'm not sure ||| Probably like I said, school campaigns and media campaigns. I feel like something to do with social connections, charity, community building etc should be a class in school ||| Probably not, but it's a start. I also do think politicians need to show more leadership in leading the charge even if their constituents don't all agree right away. Politicians are elected to be leaders not followers. ||| Not sure how people can be punished for lack of empathy, it would depend on the situation I suppose. But people should definitely call out others more for lack of caring. ||| I agree with that. Best wishes. goodbye"
p060,"I find humanities lack of care for the environment disgusting. The fact the there are companies that profit off the destruction of forests and homes and animals is mind blowing. Entire acres of forest are being destroyed for the wood they hold. Inside those forests are animals that have homes and families. They are all being displaced, or worse killed, by these greedy businessmen looking to turn a profit off of nature. After reading this article it sounds like the government of Indonesia is not committed to protecting the forests or the animals living in them. It almost seems like they are making money off of the death of nature, and so they are turning a blind eye to the violation of its very own laws.  ||| I can't believe that this is what America has become. People are dying every day. They are dying at the hands of those who should be protecting us. They are dying at the hands of random strangers with a vendetta. At what point does all this stop and do civilians get to feel safe again? If guns aren't the problem then what is the problem? If the police aren't the problem then who is responsible for these deaths? ||| I can't even imagine that these people must have gone through. Imagine being at a concert, enjoying yourself, and then all of a sudden you are being shot at. You are watching your friends drop to the floor dead. The people hiding had to endure so much. Just sitting there waiting to be killed. I will never understand how a human can inflict that kind of suffering on another human. It is such a terrible and scary thing.","Hello. What did you think of the article? ||| I agree. I can't believe that people get to make money off of destroying nature. ||| While I was reading the article I started thinking that the Indonesian government must be getting some sort of financial incentive to ignore the destruction. ||| That's a great idea. I don't know what will make companies stop destroying the earth. Nothing seems to be working. ||| Have you ever seen an orangutan in real life? It is unreal how human like they seem. I kept thinking about that while reading the article, they must be so scared. ||| I feel like sadly it is only going to get worse because right now a lot of the world is refusing to believe they are destroying the earth. ||| I know this is kind of morbid, but I feel like maybe all the scientists are right and we really only have a certain number of years left before we kill the earth. Feels like they are getting close to cutting all the trees down at least. ||| It would be nice to see some sort of group created that has the power to punish all countries that allow stuff like this to happen. ||| I know, here in America is feels like the government wants to destroy the environment. Maybe everyone in power is getting paid to keep quiet about he issues ||| I hope so, it makes so much more sense. I think sometimes nothing is going to change because so many people are afraid of new technology ||| Lets hope that doesnt happen! It was nice to meet you, have a great day. goodbye ||| I agree. I think it is completely out of hand. It is a hard situation to fix though, so many people think the police can do no wrong. ||| I can't even imagine what it must be like to be black and have to deal with the cops I would be so scared all the time. I never realized how lucky I was in all my dealings with the police in my life. ||| There was a big case here in New York, some poor guy was selling bootleg cigarettes on the corner in New York City and the cops arrested him. The guy was kind of big I guess and they were scared of him so they wound up choking him to death. For selling illegal cigarettes. The cops got to keep their jobs too I think. White people here mostly think the cops are perfect so nothing will ever change ||| It's good that they are at least being held accountable. Know what really blows my mind, is that until a few years ago when the Trayvon Martin case happened, no one even knew these things were happening. I never would have believed that cops were murdering black people for no reason. It's so crazy that  everyone ignored what was happening ||| I agree. It just seems to be getting worse. There are so many people who I would have sworn were not racist, and now they very clearly are. I guess they were all in hiding waiting until they felt safe enough acting racist. It's terrible. I don't know how it can't be fixed ||| I always think about what would happen if everyone just went blind tomorrow. We wouldn't be able to see what anyone looked like. We would actually have to judge people on meaningful things other than their skin tone of their body shape. I mean obviously it would be terrible to not be able to see, but its interesting to think about. ||| Wow that is so obnoxious. It is amazing people like that have made it this long without getting into a ton of fights everywhere they go ||| What do you think would even help the situation at this point? ||| I agree. People really are terrible. Hopefully as all the older people leave this planet the younger people can act differently, but it isn't looking too promising ||| Well I meant as they die naturally, I dopnt ||| Sorry my last message got cut off because I pressed enter too soon ! Have a great day. goodbye ||| Hello@ I am Jen how are you ||| I am good. What did you think of the article? ||| It is terrible. I have gone to many concerts in my life and I never had to worry about being shot. It is scary that we all have to worry about that now. ||| It seems like any public event isn't safe anymore. A few weeks ago there was a shooting at a garlic festival in California. There were families there. It is so sad ||| The beginning of the article talked about a victims dad finding out his daughter was dead. It said he found out over social media. I can't imagine how scary it must be not to know if your child is alive. ||| Me too. I don't know how they can prevent these things from happening ||| Can you imagine being one of the people who were hiding in the venue. It said they hid for over an hour while hearing gunshots. That must have been so scary ||| I wonder what kind of person can hurt people like that. I can't imagine killing another person. ||| It is so true. I am worried for everyone in the world. If humans are able to kill each other so easily things are only going to get worse. ||| Have a great day! goodbye"
p061,"This is so upsetting. Polar Bears clearly need the ice in order to hunt for their food. Without the ice, how will they get food? The Polar Bears will slowly starve to death. How horrible is that? When will we wake up and do something about global warming before it is too late? Before we know it, the polar bears will be extinct. So sad.  ||| This is disgusting. I have no doubt this woman is telling the truth. It seems men these days including our own president think that this behavior is acceptable. Because there is no proof, probably nothing will be done. God help any woman these days who is harassed or touched or even raped and doesn't have proof. There is no justice any more. We have to worry about our daughters. ","I feel sad and worried about the polar bears. You? ||| I'm really concerned that there are people who still don't believe this is happening and think global warming is a hoax. ||| The problem is people who don't want to listen. And now the polar bears are suffering. ||| There needs to be more awareness raised but it seems like it is just too late. ||| What do you think we can do? ||| Yes. But I am afraid it will be too late and the damage will be done. ||| What should we start with aside from awareness? More clean energy maybe? ||| I agree, but I think there also needs to be laws and regulations in place because there are people who just don't care ||| It's not going to happen here in the US with the current president unfortunately. ||| It is, which makes it even harder. ||| I guess we can just do our part by raising awareness and not being wasteful ||| Yes that's a good start and the more people doing it the better ||| That's a great idea. We turn off all the lights during the day and make sure we always turn them off when we leave the room. And we unplug appliances that aren't being used ||| I try to teach my kids about saving energy too. And we make sure we recycle and neve litter ||| Yes that's true, there needs to be more encouragement for kids though, in school and at home ||| You too ||| Bye ||| bye ||| goodbye ||| In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this. ||| In some cases maybe. Or maybe more women are just speaking up when they were afraid to before, since it's so hard to prove one way or the other. ||| I guess it's hard to imagine anyone would want to be recognized for something like that. I mean you never know, I guess. What do you think a woman should do if she's been a victim but has no proof? It's pretty easy to just grab or touch someone without anyone else seeing ||| Sure, that would be helpful but even then if you have no proof it doesn't really matter if it just happened does it? It could still be seen as a ploy for attention or an attempt to bring someone down. Or there could be shame involved too. Not everyone is just out to get attention. Some victims are too ashamed to say anything. ||| I suppose so. But we can't really punish women for coming forward just because they don't have proof. ||| That's true, there needs to be proof before punishment. Anyone who is fired for something like that without proof should be able to sue for wrongful termination. ||| It is definitely a difficult situation. ||| Yep. Or companies would have to start putting cameras up everywhere which is also ridiculous. We just need to teach our children how to handle these situations and hope for the best. ||| I hope so. ||| You too. bye"
p062,"I find the article comical.  In these places, people are starving to death and the concern of some people is whether zoo animals are getting enough to eat.  The zoo animals should be slaughtered to feed people.  The horses slaughtered to feed to animals should be fed to people.  The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.  That's my opinion. ||| I like polar bears but I don't really care that much about their survival or extinction.  We look at ourselves and our place in the universe as being important, and as if our time defines the universe the way it's supposed to exist.  Polar bears haven't existed for like 99.9999% of the history of the universe, and now we think it's some travesty that they won't exist in the future.  This is incredibly arrogant and self-centered thinking that I think is silly.  I guess I'd rather have a world with polar bears.  But I also largely don't care. ||| A few thoughts about this.  First, amazing how far down the car accident death statistics are.  That's amazing.  Second, I find it interesting that 2007 is when young suicides spike.  That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, \I just wish I could go to sleep forever.\""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.  Like it was preordained or something."" ||| This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government. ||| I don't care about refugees.  We can't have empathy for every single person in the world.  There are just too many.  It's not practical.  You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch. ||| I think divorce is always sad, even when children are grown.  However, this is also just one divorce in a great big world and I can't say I really care.  I thought it was sort of peculiar how tritely the article dealt with the situation, though, seemingly paying more attention to how hot the dad was instead of the dissolution of a family.  And you wonder why marriages dissolve after 27 years and the kids grown.  What changes to push people to divorce at that point.  Maybe for married people that's not a complicated question, but I'm not married so I don't know.  Either way I think it's too bad for the girls that their parents are divorced.  But I'm not really moved by it. ||| I don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it. ||| I honestly find this article more amusing than anything.  I absolutely loathe birds.  Can't stand them.  Want them all dead.  I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.  The Asians are. ||| I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else? ||| This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful. ||| I didn't really feel anything from this story.  I don't care about amphibians and certainly don't care about them in England.  I just thought the science of it all was interesting, or the analysis . But it shows what humans do to all environments they come in contact with.  They change them.  The migrate and bring in new things.  And that affects stuff.  That's not always our fault, but that's the way of things.  And yet we think it's fine to let refugees and immigrants go where they want, as if there aren't repercussions for that. There are repercussions for everything.  Migration changes habitats.  Change isn't inherently bad, but it's inherently different, and people don't like that. ||| I wonder if this type of thing is going to become more common as more people are forced to take care of elderly relatives at home.  Or mentally ill relatives.  Or both.  I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.  She might be scared and confused too. ||| I don't feel empathy for the refugees, who are complicit in corruption and worthless systems of government that lead to their need to flee.  Nor do I think they have any right to do what they're doing.  And every country has every right to keep them out and let them deal with their own situation in their own country.  But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.  How disgusted would I be if I were a German citizen and Merkel said Germany would take in one million refugees.  Why not just hand the country over to Syria and these other craphole places and we'll go live on their sand piles?  It's lunacy. ||| I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL. ||| It's always harder to view these stories from the perspective of a single individual instead of as a group.  That's not to say we should necessarily do that, or that we necessarily get anything truly valuable out of doing that, but it's the reality.  And so I felt sad reading this, thinking about the loss this father felt, and all the terrible emotions he would have experienced from the beginning of the even to, well, his death, probably.  And the terror of the people at the concert.  And the anger of the people afterwards who committed harassment and whatnot against Muslims.  All of the emotions I felt and was chagrined by.  These are barbaric people and events. ||| I'm gonna be honest: I just don't care about this stuff anymore.  We're exposed to so many stories of trouble and heartache and loss and danger that I feel like I can't be responsible for it anymore.  Not financially, morally, emotionally, practically, whatever.  I just don't care.  Syria is an absolute mess and millions of people are suffering and I feel like I don't care because it's not my problem.  Either way its' not my problem but if it were smaller and I could do something about it, maybe I wouldn't feel so disinterested.  But we're just bombarded with this shit constantly to the point I just stop giving a damn. ||| I do feel for the people in the country, especially the starving kids, who presumably don't understand what's going on except for the fact that they're hungry.  But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem. ||| I have very little sympathy for refugees of any type.  They go to another country and expect to be accommodated.  A country and government's first priority should be to its own people.  These other people have no inherent rights to be taken care of or even allowed to enter the country.  We exist in a world of borders and law--for the better.  These people come from countries that are hellholes they must flee, and they are complicit in that.  How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me.  They have no right to that.  This refugee issue is going to get more problematic and I think it behooves non crappy countries to decide, well in advance, what they're going to do about mass refugee groups, how many they'll take, etc.  you can't wait until they're ther ||| This is a tragic story but it's also what happens in third-world countries where you pull a truck off the side of the road to sell fuel to citizens.  The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead. ||| I don't really care about this at all.  I don't care about herring or abalone or whatever the diesel oil harmed.  I think it's ridiculous that the premiere of B.C., of the awful NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they did the best they could in difficult conditions.  But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.  But what can be done about any of this now other than clean it up and try not to have it happen again.  Either way I don't care. ||| I don't care about this at all.  There are well over one billion Indians and Pakistanis.  We have enough of them.  I don't care if a few get lost from these people fighting over Kashmir.  That's been going on for decades anyway.  I'm sure it's pointless, but these two sides won't back down so it'll keep going on.  They're too nuclear powers so that's the only thing that makes this kind of interesting.  I love how the Bollywood directors won't hire Pakistani actors.  Pakistan sucks.  They harbor a lot of terrorists and a lot of bad crap happens in, and comes out of, Pakistan.  I'm sure they're to blame for most of the hostilities in the region. ||| I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned.  ||| This incident made me feel bad.  I assume it was just an accident and a case of confusion and miscommunication.  But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.  Hopefully the truth is discovered and people can be content with the tragic event. ||| This article is ridiculous.  I'm part Jewish and all of this is absurd.  Likening our country to Nazi Germany in any way is just embarrassing.  The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?  People are stupid, even Jews, some of the smartest people in the world. ||| I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it. ||| I guess I feel bad whenever these stories involve the depiction of children struggling.  Putting kids into foster homes where they must feel so confused and alone and scared makes me feel for them.  On the other hand, there's a reality to these situations that can't be ignored.  The real germ of these childrens' problem was their mother going to jail.  That's the germ.  After that they have to be raised by someone.  And then the children compound their problem by being delinquents.  I knew a boy who'd been adopted after growing up in a very violent environment.  The damage had already been done.  He tore apart the adoptive family and ruined his own life.  He's in jail in China now, for 20 years.  These situations are horrendous, but the fault lies with the parents, not the state. ||| I think this is sad, although there aren't many details to know what really happened.  I can't decide whether I think it was worse or better that they died together.  Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.  Even though they're dead bodies it seems lonely that they'd be there without getting taken back to civilization. ||| It's a sad story for the father, for sure, but I also don't really care.  I don't know these people.  They're also foreigners, so I care even less.  But still, the thought of losing all your family like that is harsh.  And the people who killed them are dead.  I'm not sure if that's better or worse.  No place to direct your anger and despair.  Maybe that's a good thing.  Still, a devastating even to have to deal with and live with the rest of his life.  I'm sure the pain will never end.  I can't imagine dealing with that. ||| Part of me feels sympathy for these people and the terror they're experiencing.  And yet part of me thinks that it's a problem of their own making.  These people are sheep.  Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.  Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side.  Why, thousands and thousands of years later, can these people still not create stable cultures? ||| I've never heard about this issue before.  It seems typical for the region, however.  Economy at all costs, especially when you have two trillion people living in these geographically small countries.  And you wonder why environmentalism is a losing battle.  The U.S. and other civilized countries can do all they want.  If a place like Indonesia is willing to burn down all their forests to manufacture palm oil, you're fighting a losing battle.  Again, I keep getting back to this idea: Why are we considered the barbarians in the world?  Most of the world are one step above apes.  They're heathens.  What Reagan said to Nixon was correct.  We treat these people as equals?  We leave our fate to people who don't even wear shoes?  Absurd. ||| I find this story to be eye-rollingly typical of people.  I assume that the people who go up to the Arctic to see it like polar bears and don't want to see them extinct.  And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.  Survival of the fittest. ||| This story is bothersome on a number of levels.  Obviously people are going to be angry at the shop owner and the family, which they should.  And obviously the authorities, who do nothing and allow this to go on.  But what about the families who keep having children they feel obligated to send to work at age 11 and 12?  Stop having children you can't feed.  These countries are all grossly overpopulated but they keep having kids.  The parents feel bad that their kids got treated this way, but they're the ones who sent them there. ||| I suppose this is about an orphaned rhino due to poaching.  I had a hard time really feeling that much for the rhino.  It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.  I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way. ||| I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me. ||| This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either. ||| This one sort of gets to me.  The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.  Awful to live with. ||| I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either. ||| This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry. ||| This article was sad for me.  It definitely humanized the event and focused on the father, whom I felt sympathetic towards.  I also laughed a lot at the sentence about someone wrapping bacon around the door handle of a mosque.  But I thought the portrayal of the father was very real and relatable.  I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why.  But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event.  People there, trying to survive.  People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead.  People angry.  People trying to keep the public safe.  All angles were shown. ||| This is all disgusting and makes me wonder how anyone could have sympathy or pause for battling militant Islam head-on.  These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.  These Arabs and Persians are just so passive and impotent with their overlords. ||| I feel really bad for the rangers, who were just doing their job and were treated unmercifully by the villagers.  And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information. ||| I hate hearing about American troop deaths.  I feel sad for the Captain and First Sergeant who died.  Those are experienced and high-ranking people.  I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.  And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death. ||| I mostly feel contempt from this story.  I do feel some sympathy for the people who were raped and killed in the recent violence, particularly the foreign workers.  However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.  Just stupidness all around. ||| I feel some amount of sympathy for this girl because I can't imagine what it would be like to lose your eyesight like that.  In one brief moment the world goes from visible to invisible in an instant.  It's got to be nearly traumatic (although she seems to be remaining upbeat).  But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened.  Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings.  I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted.  If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected.  If she wasn't part of the unrest, then she should have fled the area. ||| I don't really care about this issue, in part because I don't even understand it.  All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?  Screw that. ||| I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die. ||| This is a disturbing story and I feel badly for the kitten who was obviously abused and presumably tortured.  I assume this was done by a psychopath who likes sadistic things.  Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.  It reduces the empathy and sympathy I feel when I read a story like this. ||| It must be terrifying to be in a trail derailment like that.  Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.  Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen. ||| This story basically didn't bother me at all, except for the fact that the media seemed to unnecessarily conflate the shooting with the election, even when they later admit that the shooting had nothing to do with the election. There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.  I have no idea what this shooting was and honestly do not care.","I always think stories of foster kids are pretty sad. ||| Of course the kids make matters worse with delinquency, but that's not unexpected behavior considering their experiences. ||| Yes, although even in good situations it sometimes doesn't work.  I knew an adopted boy and girl who'd come from a very violent background.  They destroyed the adoptive family they were brought into.  The damage had already been done to them as people. ||| Yeah, bless the people who are willing to do that.  And I'm sure most have good intentions.  But it's definitely a tough situation for everyone. ||| At least there was something of a silver lining in this story. ||| Yes, although I'd also go back to the mother and say the problem starts there. The mother (and probably father) were the first to let the kids down. ||| Yes, unfortunately.  It's very easy to have children but not so easy to raise them well. ||| Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do. ||| It's a strange phenomenon.  At least to me.  But we're often more creatures of habit and genetics and convenience than of thoughtful consideration and values. ||| Do you have any children? ||| Sounds fun.  I hope you're successful and you, your husband, and future children are all thankful for it.  I don't have kids and figure it's best for all parties involved that it stays that way. ||| Yes,it's certainly a big responsibility.  But I'm sure you'll do fine. ||| Anyway, it's been nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye ||| I can relate to them in some ways I think ||| mental illness is horrible and they deserve help ||| They have done so much for us we owe it to them ||| Its all about money, it creates money so it will continue to happen ||| It all needs to stop but we both know it will not ||| Do you believe that's what it is?

I wonder what behavioral changes biologists are noticing in their behavior.  Certainly the bears will change something to try to survive, although the Arctic doesn't give them too many options, probably. ||| I wonder if we can even do anything about it?  Even if we decrease CO2 production, their environment might continue to melt away. ||| They're definitely majestic animals.  It seems ironic that something that's so big and powerful can seem so impotent in the face of the vicissitudes of mother nature. ||| Still, we tend to think that the world is supposed to be the way we know it now.  We, like polar bears, have only existed for the tiniest fraction of the earth's and universe's history.  And yet we thing it's anomalous for us to not be here. ||| I imagine that the increasing push to get oil out of the Arctic will further threaten the polar bears' habitat. ||| I don't think most people have the will, and developing countries are the biggest question, not the already-developed world. ||| Are you doing anything about it or just hoping? ||| Right, and that's the biggest impediment to any substantive change.  People aren't willing to live a lifestyle other than the one they know.  I've thrown up my hands and think it's all pointless.  The dye is cast.  Now we reap what we've sown. ||| Agree, but apparently there are much larger problems than just cars.  Apparently the concrete industry is like the single-worst thing, and nobody talks about that at all. ||| Yes, those countries are terrible.  We worry over here about plastic straws and stuff like that, but that stuff is totally irrelevant. ||| That's pretty horrific. ||| Anyway, I'm about done.  Unless you want to say anything else I'll end the conversation in the next round. ||| you too.  bye ||| I thought it was sad, too.  There weren't many details though.  I wonder what happened for both of them to die. ||| I think they know where the bodies are but can't retrieve them.  That was my interpretation.  That seems sort of lonely, even though they're dead. ||| Yes, I'm sure she's incredibly distraught.  I also wondered, was it better or worse that the father and son died together? ||| I'm sure.  I also wonder whether one of them did something that caused problems for them both.  Like, one slipped and then they both fell when the other tried to save the first.  That would be awful. ||| As sad as it is, hiking is dangerous.  Mother Nature can be brutal.  You always take risk when you go out like that. ||| This story reminded me of my dog.  She tumbled over a cliff of sorts, fell into a river bed, and was never seen again.  Made me very sad. ||| Yes, that's a good philosophy.  We don't show enough love and appreciation to those we care about. ||| This is sort of why I wonder whether it was better or worse emotionally for them to be together.  Either they appreciated the companionship and comfort of having the other person there, or it was worse because they knew neither would get out, and perhaps one even caused the death of the other. ||| Yes, I think they're both dead.  I think they fell off a cliff or something.  Or there was a rock slide or something.  That'd be my guess, although I really don't know. ||| I thought it said they fell, although maybe I'm misremembering, or assumed that incorrectly.  But yeah, it could be a lot of things.  Getting lost, animals.  I suppose they could have even gotten sick eating something, although they were just hiking so they probably wouldn't need to eat anything they found. ||| Yeah, that would be a minor miracle.  Anyway, nice talking to you, too. ||| bye ||| The suicide numbers are disconcerting, but I'm amazed at the improvement in the car accident death numbers. ||| I thought it was interesting that the suicide spike was in 2007, when I think the iPhone was introduced.  Not saying there's a direct causation there, but I don't think pervasive internet and social media has been good for children's (or anyone's) mental health. ||| Yes, I think you're exactly right about the comparison part.  We're exposed to so many images to compare ourselves to.  Exponentially more than we used to be.  That weighs heavily on many. ||| I think so, too, although I think that's partly a function of the environment they're growing up in. ||| I have to admit that I laughed at the article when the expert said that it's not normal to say things like, \I wish I could just go to sleep forever.\""  I've been saying that every day for 30 years."" ||| What I didn't relate to was when she said a teen might kill themselves because of a fight with their boyfriend.  I never remember having feelings nearly that volatile. ||| I think they also live so much of their lives, and relationships, online.  And there's something more powerful about that, as counterintuitive as it sounds.  it's like it exists inside you, so it's not diluted by anything, instead of existing in reality, outside of you. ||| I can't fathom what it must be like for a parent to lose a child through suicide.  Not only the obvious loss, but the incredible guilt that they must feel, rightly or wrongly. ||| Sure, although we're all guilty of that to various degrees. ||| Yeah, that's probably got to be about as bad as it gets. ||| Yes, depression is definitely a large factor.  Too bad because it's something that's not treated simply.  Although we certainly try to throw a lot of drugs at this type of thing now. ||| Yes, I think it's not a great situation.  Anyway, it was good talking to you.  I'm going to sign off here.  bye ||| This conflict is a mess but I can't pretend like I really care. ||| Sure, I understand that.  But people are about as valuable as cockroaches from a certain perspective.  And these people are about cockroaches from any perspective. ||| I'd say it's just a certain perspective.  Besides, I'm realistic about war.  There's going to be collateral damage.  If you fight in a war you should fight to win, and that means some \innocents\"" getting killed."" ||| Pretty much.  I mean, there are considerations to be made.  Like, if we violate the Geneva Convention it all but assures there will be ramifications for our troops.  But war is life and death.  I believe that if you aren't willing to fight in a way that MOST protects your own troops and your own nation, then you shouldn't fight at all. ||| If I were one of them I'd be okay with it.  From an objective perspective I don't think there's any authority that should prevent someone from doing that if that's what they think is right.  But obviously I don't agree with it because it affected my home country.  I understand your point but it really doesn't change anything I've said. ||| Sure, I understand that.  But that's sort of my point.  I'm going to look out for my interests.  You're going to look out for yours.  I'm not going to look for trouble.  But if trouble finds me, whoa nelly, look out.  Why should I play by a set of \feel good\"" rules and harm myself in the process."" ||| So give me your perspective on Yemen.  How do you think that problem should be dealt with?  Keep fighting the Houtis, or concede and allow them to take over the country and government they've overthrown (with Iran's backing). ||| So just let the old regime and the Houthi rebels fight, and whoever wins gets to control the country?  While the rest of the world stays out of it except for aid? ||| Yeah, I'm not arguing with what you said (although I personally don't agree).  I'm just trying to understand.  Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region? ||| I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb. ||| Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst. ||| We should do more with them, I think.  Not a hot war, where the ramifications are too great though.  See, I'm realistic too.  Anyway, interesting chat.  Thanks.  bye ||| The refugee problem seems like it's getting worse.  We like to think the world is getting more civilized, but I guess not. ||| I'm sure.  History appears to change but, as you say, man's instincts remain the same.  I think all the time, not just in desperate circumstances. ||| I understood your point.  I just didn't really care.  Like I don't care about the refugees. ||| The world is too large to make individual problems global problems, and global problems individual problems.  The math doesn't work. ||| Yes, I'm suggesting that I not make the problems of other individual people to be my problem.  They can create a country that's not a hellhole they have to flee from.  Somehow many countries have accomplished that. ||| I disagree with most of that.  And we certainly don't have to answer the door. ||| We could shoot these people at the border.  Maybe they'd reconsider fleeing and put up a fight in their own hellhole country. ||| Your solution is to deal with the symptom, not the true disease.  You let countries get infested at the top and become unlivable, and everyone--Africans, Middle Easterners, Asians, and Hispanics--flee into civilized countries.  That's not a long term solution. ||| Allowing dictators and corruption to lead other countries.  As far as I'm concerned the same people who flee their oppression are responsible for it.  They are responsible for their own leadership which they feel forced to flee.  I see no reason why they should piggyback off of our ability to live semi-harmoniously and threaten that. ||| Well, believe what you want, it doesn't change reality.  I do have no responsibility to them.  They have responsibility to themselves.  And the influence the US has in these places is grossly overblown.  Either way these are brown-skinned savages.  Subhumans. ||| Yes.  I do.  These people have had 10,000 years to become civilized.  They haven't.  Look at Africa.  It's a joke. EVERYTHING they have of modern culture is from empirialism.  Anyway, enlightening chat.  Thanks for having it with me.  bye ||| Very tragic story.  I can't imagine being the father and trying to live with that pain. ||| I wonder how the death of the people who crashed into the van will affect the father.  Now he has nowhere to direct his anger and grief.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad. ||| Have you ever experienced an accident like this one?  Or known anyone who did? ||| I'm extremely sorry to hear that.  It must have been devastating. ||| I imagine the family members in this situation are saying a lot of \what ifs.\""  These people were even visiting from another country."" ||| Yes.  But at least the deceased are at peace now.  They were probably tortured brutally as they burned alive in that van.  But there's no more pain now. ||| I think limiting immigration and brown-faced people from entering the country would help.  Did you notice that the person who caused the accident had a hispanic name, and of course the deceased were hispanic too. ||| Why, are you brown-faced? ||| That would explain this chat. ||| Your question answers itself. ||| bye ||| I'd say that even in the situations where it's the healthiest for all parties, it's still sad that it came to that.  But I understand your point. ||| I'm sorry to hear your parents divorced.  How did you view their divorce then and how do you view it now?  Do you think it was for the best? ||| I thought the article was pretty glib about it all, focusing more on the fact that the day is apparently hot.  Then again, it was TMZ. ||| Not that it matters, but I wonder about the circumstances regarding this type of divorce.  I can understand couples with kids and, you know, 8 years into marriage discovering that they can't keep doing it.  But 27 years, with adult kids.  That I don't readily comprehend.   I guess he got bored or something. ||| Yeah.  I also wonder how much being on the periphery of fame and fortune influences things.  You see a lifestyle that's more tempting but that you can't really participate in.  I wonder if that leads people to more strongly feel a desire for \more\"" and it's easier to be discontent with what you have."" ||| Yeah, it pretty much all boils down to chasing trim. ||| Yeah.  Just to be clear, I wasn't making fun of you.  I agree that these are biological drives we can't ignore.  I was just stating that in a glib way. ||| Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me. ||| Yeah, nice talking to you.  bye ||| It's pretty vile, that's for sure. ||| I agree. Although I also think these countries that house and tolerate radical Islam need to step up as well.  They need to be forced to make a choice between civil societies or barbarism. ||| Agreed.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of cultures where passivity is the norm for the populace.  They accept whatever tyrant it is that wants to lead and abuse them. ||| Absolutely.  And so, to some degree, they deserve their fate. ||| Absolutely.  You can't allow that virus to infect civilized cultures. ||| And yet there are many people and countries who like to think we're the bad guys.  People should get a clue and look in the face of true barbarism. ||| Absolutely.  But when you're the biggest fish, people are going to resent you.  We spend too much time concerning ourselves with what other people think of us.  Who cares?  They resent us because of our power, not because of how we wield it.  They want us to be weak.  That's when they \approve\"" of what we do."" ||| I think we need a few more rounds.  We can do this quickly.  I'd love to see us actively destroy ISIS. ||| Be interesting to see if terrorism is discussed at all in the upcoming election.  Probably not. ||| yeah, good chatting.  bye ||| It's pretty amazing how many people they think died.  Although Indonesia has an extremely large population.  I think it's one of the top 4 or 5 in the world. ||| Well, it just means the population is more dense, and more people get affected by the haze. ||| I think it's pitiful because it shows what the rest of the world is up against with respect to environmental issues.  These countries are more concerned about their economics than enivronment.  They burn down forests to make palm oil. ||| At least those ones aren't started intentionally.  Well, I mean some of them might be arson, but that's different. ||| I just think it's amazing the different perspective different people have on society and value of life and that type of thing.  Can you imagine the U.S. government, or even state governments, allowing burning down forests that killed tens or hundreds of thousands of people like this? ||| On the other hand, if they outlawed the palm oil industry, they might have hundreds of thousands of people starve. ||| Absolutely.  I believe palm oil production has some other really bad effect on the environment.  I can't remember what.  Maybe something to do with polluting the water. ||| Yeah, that's the part they don't even know about.  I can't fathom the long-term damage to kids if this haze is killing hundreds of thousands outright. ||| That would be nice but I'm not sure it would get through to them.  Money talks more than the health concerns of millions of people they don't actually care about. ||| Oh, it's gotta be.  That and contraception. ||| Definitely.  sex traffickers. ||| Yeah, I think we nailed it. ||| Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Take care.  bye ||| I'm curious how they're dying.  Are people hunting them or are their habitats being affected. ||| No, it sure didn't.  But yeah, it seems ridiculous that people are going up there, possibly to enjoy the polar bears, and they're dying as a result. ||| They're in pretty bad trouble, for sure.  We'll see if their behavior changes in their changing environment. ||| It definitely could be. And the arctic isn't a very friendly place to try to figure out where to get more food. ||| Yes, but I suppose people want to see them in the wild.  Have you ever seen a polar bear in person? ||| I've seen them too.  They look cuddly and friendly but of course they're not. ||| Indeed.  It'll be shocking if such a big, familiar animal goes extinct in our lifetime.  I suppose they won't because of the zoos.  But they might disappear from the wild. ||| I think some humans.  But we're like cockroaches.  I think we'll find a way to survive.  Or most of us will. ||| I sort of feel like we'll get what we deserve.  If we deserve to suffer from our treatment of the environment, we will. ||| Yeah, that's another perspective.  Bears and humans have NOT existed for far, far, far more of earth's history than they have.  We tend to view the present as the way things are supposed to be.  But they're not.  That's just our narrow perspective. ||| And are much more interesting.  Maybe one day some other species will study how we died out. ||| Yeah, I'm sure they'd find plenty to be disgusted by.  Heck, people already do. ||| No.  I think we're animals and we act this way because it's in our blood. ||| Any other thoughts on this topic? ||| bye ||| I agree.  But I think they feel they need their children to earn income to support the family.  How about stop having kids. ||| It's definitely sad.  In this situation there seems to be no shortage of blame to go around.  Parents, slave-owners, authorities. ||| That's probably part of it, although I don't know much about the Burmese economy.  But overpopulation is a big problem, too.  And corrupt governments. ||| Yeah, it's situations like this that help you appreciate how similar we are to animals.  Most of what we do isn't driven by reason. ||| It's interesting how it works though.  Western countries aren't having kids at rates fast enough to replinish the population.  So it's immigrants from less-civilized nations growing the population.  In other words, an irony: the people who can't sustain themselves (as well) are the ones growing the population. ||| Yes, but that's probably been true since the beginning of humanity. ||| Yeah.  I guess it's just got to be a grass roots thing where citizens say their countries aren't going to act that way anymore, and it trickles up into authority and the governments themselves. ||| No, they paid for the children's release.  That's how I read it. ||| That's another part of it.  There's always some attempt to respect the sovereignty of nations.  But at what point do you intervene because you believe you know better. ||| Yes, I enjoyed the chat.  Thank you.  bye ||| Yes, I assume the baby was orphaned from poaching, although I'm just assuming that. ||| Yes, poaching seems brutal and unnecessary, although the people doing it would argue it's their livelihood, I suppose.  But I still find it sad. ||| Right, I think they just use the horns.   Or sell them.  These people who treat the orphaned animals must have a hard time with it.  True, there are probably success stories where they nurse them back to health and find them homes, but when they see these animals the first time they're always in a bad place. ||| Yeah, that's a good point about naming them.  They aren't just creatures at that point.  They're little personalities. ||| Yes, I agree.  I wondered what type of suffering the animal had been through.  Maybe just starving or something.  Or maybe injured.  But there weren't many details for sure. ||| Yes, I believe so.  Have you ever seen a rhino in person?  They're remarkable creatures.  Like living tanks or something.  The closest thing to dinosaurs still around, I suppose. ||| Uh huh.  I've seen them a couple times.  Rhinos and hippos always fascinate me.  Just seems such a waste to kill them, especially for a trinket. ||| I guess these people working with the orphaned animals probably feel it's about all they can do for the cause.  I'm not sure what else people can do to influence poaching in a meaningful way. ||| Yeah, I'm not sure.  I assume they're non-profit organizations, or affiliated with animal welfare groups/programs.  I assume at higher levels these organizations lobby countries to crack down harder on poaching, but of course there's money involved, so there's corruption, and these are sovereign nations anyway, so outsiders can only exert so much influence. ||| Yes, it was nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| I think it'll be interesting to see how this type of movement will progress.  It's easier than ever with social media to create social change. ||| It might.  But Saudis are proud.  If you go telling the King and his people that what they're doing is morally wrong, I think they're just as likely to spite you as to listen. ||| I'm not sure what you mean about the men.  Could you explain further? ||| What about the Saudi women who want the system to stay the same?  Do you think they're brainwashed, or suffering from Stockholm Syndrome?  Or do you think their perspective is valid too?  Just curious. ||| I think you exaggerate the consequences, but I understand your point.  My brother actually lives in Saudi Arabia and, as I said before, the male-female relational dynamics at a personal level are quite different from the systemic restraints. ||| I don't believe they're legally forced to marry, but since employment is limited, it's sort of a necessity. ||| I believe women are actually now allowed to drive.  I could be wrong about that but I think that was a recent change.  However, no, she'd have to get a male relative to sign off on her leaving the country.  Not sure about things like doctor's appointments. That might actually be the opposite, where it might be considered inappropriate for a man to be involved in that.  But not sure. ||| I think the social media and internet influence in this is interesting.  i can imagine the women at home, spending a lot of time on their phones, seeing lives they want to be leading and that, in part, motivating them to seek change.  On some level it's no different than people in the West seeing a pair of sneakers they want, or a vacation one their friends took, and being desirous of that, too. ||| Do you think the number is really as high as 99%  I think patriarchal cultures are still more prevalent than that. ||| Yes, I'm not sure.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Thanks for taking the time.  Have a good day.  bye ||| I guess I think it's sad that kids feel so sad and alienated (or whatever) that they are drawn to them.  But I also think it's pitiful that people lose themselves in internet groups like this.  It's artificial. ||| I just think that the emotions we experience online are very different--much more intense--than what we experience in reality.  Ironically.  If we'd turn off our phones and the TV and went outside, we'd discover that there's a big difference between the virtual worlds on our screens, and the real world.  And the time we spend in the virtual ones doesn't seem to be good for our mental health, especially when we're already vulnerable. ||| I agree, and I think that's sad.  It's ironic that in mental health, mindfulness is the current push.  And I think that the way we engage with the internet is the antithesis of being mindful.  So you have this strange dichotomy where more people need, or think they need, mental health help, which will push them towards things like mindfulness, while those same people do the exact opposite thing while engaging in their virtual worlds. ||| I'd suggest that in this story, the parents are most capable of providing help, in all ways, but apparently the parents are a large part of the problem, what with the drinking and abuse and whatnot. ||| The statistics intrigued me.  First, the inordinately high depression and suicide rates for Russia.  But also the 5% number (teenage depression, I believe it was) for the rest of the West.  That number seems low to me, though I don't really know. ||| I'd also suggest that the FOCUS on the internet communities themselves is maybe misguided.  Seems like a whack-a-mole problem in terms of shutting them down. ||| Absolutely.  A culture of victimhood.  But it does nothing to help the actual kids. ||| I'd agree with that.  In all parts of medicine, prescribing a pill has become the easy, satisfying thing to do. I'm flabbergasted when I see reports quoting the number of people taking things like Ambien. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| I thought the science behind why the birds eat plastic was interesting. ||| I also thought is was telling that all the worst countries in the world at dumping plastic in the ocean are Asian.  They're really bad about that stuff, obviously. ||| Could be.  I think they're attitudes about trash and pollution are different from ours though. ||| I wonder if there will be, or can be, any change to the composition of the plastics so they don't give off this sulphurous odor. ||| Sure.  I think people are lazy, though, so there will always be a ton of waste since there will always be a ton of consumption. ||| \Needs\"" in what sense?"" ||| I guess I'm looking for specific ramifications from us doing otherwise.  Needs is a strong word.  What exactly will happen if we don't ban plastic straws that makes that action imperative. ||| That's fine, I don't mind listening to people's concerns.  I have my own.  From a practical perspective, do you think there's a WILL to make these changes, even if there's a WAY? ||| Yes, as you say, back to our own immediate bubble.  At some point real weather events that directly impact people might prompt some change.  Maybe, I'd be interested to know if people who get wiped out by a hurricane or flooding change their attitudes about environmental stuff, or do even those people not change.  I think that'd be interesting data. ||| Yes, I think that's a good point.  It's easy to go back to believing everything is normal.  And it might be too late anyway.  Well, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| Yes, we certainly have a habit of encroaching on animals' habitats and doing harm to them. ||| Yes, there will always be compromises to be made.  Do we trade more greenhouse gasses for more dead birds, etc.  We're something of an invasive species and will continue to do what we do.  I think the question is just how, precisely, and what we choose to compromise. ||| Yes, and we start down a path without being fully informed about what the ramifications are.  We did the same thing 100+ years ago with coal and oil! ||| Indeed.  I do wonder if there are specific things they can do to protect the birds, though.  Someone must be thinking of something.  Like, scents that deter them, or colors or something.  I don't know much about birds but you'd think there'd be some way to scare them or deter them from those locations. ||| I would think so, but maybe it isn't a high priority or something.  I'm guessing the companies with a vested interest in wind farms don't want the bird killing to be paid attention to.  And maybe animal rights groups don't have the resources or something.  Not sure but I personally never hear that much about wind farms, positive or negative.  Energy talk tends to center around oil and coal. ||| Right.  And I also feel like we, the people, don't get to have that much say.  This is a larger conversation than we have time for, but my energy costs have spiked dramatically in the last few years because the energy company is going towards wind, and it's expensive.  I'm not saying that isn't what I'd ultimately choose, but I don't even get a choice.  I have one utility company and have to accept their monopoly. ||| The other thing I'd be interested about is what rodent populations are like around these wind farms.  If you kill all the birds of prey, how does that affect these lands for farming or grazing.  You wonder if land owners, who've agreed to have these wind turbines erected on their lands, will regret it. ||| Yes, it was great chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| I feel bad for the orangutans!  But this palm oil issue seems to be a very big one in Indonesia. ||| Yes, the article sure was.  But apparently Indonesia cuts down forests to grow palm trees to make palm oil.  But the palm oil industry is apparently terrible for the environment in all sorts of ways. ||| Right, particularly when what they're doing apparently violates an international agreement they're apparently part of.  But it's about economics, so that usually wins out. ||| Yes.  So you have the age-old question of what are the rights of mankind and what are the rights of nature?  But also, what is best for mankind's present versus the future?  There's always a compromise, and we usually choose us, and now. ||| Yeah, me too.   These are complicated issues.  There isn't some simple, perfect answer or we'd likely have found it. ||| But I do think it underscores one challenge we have in these global issues.  Different countries/cultures/economies see the world very differently.  In the west, in our relative prosperity, we focus on certain things.  And in these high-population, low-wealth countries, they focus on much more basic goals.  Sort of like a Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs thing.  The point is, getting everyone to go along with some worldwide issue like reducing greenhouse gases, is extremely difficult if not impossible. ||| For sure.  I was also wondering about orangutan populations and how bad they actually are.  Not sure where else they live, or if there are healthier populations elsewhere. ||| That's the other thing with all these issues.  I admit I'm ignorant, but I'm also not sure if I can even trust information and data we get, or for sources to really represent the whole picture.  Everything is so political and narrow.  And we're just bombarded with so many issues and opinions these days.  At some point you just throw up your hands and say, I'm not sure what to think. ||| That's the thing about the internet.  I think people feel they're MORE informed these days, but I'm not sure it's the opposite.  There's just too much information.  I don't think our brains are designed to handle so much.  We can make sense of what we can touch (figuratively) but trying to comprehend this incomprehensibly large planet?  I think it's too much. ||| Yes, I admit that I'm as guilty as anyone.  I cherry pick opinions and stories that corroborate my beliefs. ||| Yes, nice taking with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| This is certainly a contentious issue. ||| Yes, I like to say that just because a story is true, doesn't make it representative of the country as a whole.  If the news decided to run stories about kidnappings, they could very easily have the country go into a panic over that.  We get just the slightest sliver of a glimpse of the country through the news, and it skews our perspective. ||| Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do. ||| Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens. ||| Yeah, precisely.  I also ask myself in these issues, how much danger do we expect these cops to put themselves in?  How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do. ||| Yes, I think that teachers and principals have largely abdicated their authority and influence.  Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children. ||| Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion. ||| Yeah, it's just crazy.  Even the people who believe that's how it should be can't help offending people.  There's always someone who's going to be offended.  We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims. ||| Absolutely.  And the ultimate irony is that by trying to make everyone's life struggle-free, we increase their struggles by making everyone less capable of dealing with them.  We know it's unhealthy and unproductive to treat kids like this, make them soft and feeble.  It's not just silly, it's actually detrimental to the people we're trying to protect. ||| Yeah, it's a bizarre tack we've taken and I wonder when it or if we'll change course.  Anyway, it was great talking with you.  I really enjoyed it.  Hope you have a great day.  bye ||| Yes, we have short memories now.  One tragedy or threat or whatever replaces another with great speed. ||| Yes, I worry at what point we collectively stop caring.  Is the world a better place because I learn about some school bus that crashes in some part of the world I know nothing about?  That sounds callous but the world is incomprehensibly large.  We can't concern ourselves with the fate of all 7 billion people. ||| One thing in the story that stuck out to me was the band that played the show that got attacked.  I'd feel awful for the rest of my life if that had been my band.  People came to MY show.  I WANTED them to come to MY show.  And they ended up dead or traumatized because of it.  I'd feel devastated by that. ||| The response of France also sounded a lot like a U.S. response to a similar event.  The government claims more power to insure safety.  Backlash against Muslims increases for a time.  People mourn.  It could have been America after 9/11.  My point is, people are largely people, even though other countries like to paint the U.S. as different.  Of course it is in ways, but we're also just all people. ||| I was in Washington D.C. after 9/11.  It was always eerie driving past the Pentagon and other areas and seeing humvees with guided missiles pointing to the sky. ||| Yeah, I find with a lot of these issues that we lose perspective.  The world becomes so small when we distill it down to extreme events and watch it on a screen.  But the world is incomprehensibly large.  This country is.  A state is, even a city.  I'm sure right now a lot of parents are sincerely worried about sending their kids to school.  The reality is that they're more likely to win the lottery than ever experience someone they love getting killed in a mass shooting. ||| Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or even an improvement.  We seem hell-bent on running towards a world of greater and greater manipulation.  We joke about \1984\"" and that type of dystopia and yet we can't put down our phones."" ||| Yeah, it's hard.  But I think that feeling of despondency is probably shared by many people, in various ways and for various reasons.  We see too much of the world now.  We recognize our own futility and insignificance and impotence more than ever.  I think our brains are designed to live in smaller worlds, worlds we feel in more control of. ||| I agree.  I also think what I said is true.  Maybe. ||| Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye ||| I had a black lab mix once and so I felt sad thinking about her dying. ||| No, but I could relate to the idea of losing a pet unexpectedly.  Have any of your pets or children or family members ever been shot in front of you? ||| Well that's good news. ||| As for the story, I sympathize with the woman but I also think it's unacceptable to have your dog off the leash like that.  I'm not saying the guy needed to kill it, but I find it wholly unacceptable to expose people to uncontrolled dogs, especially in environments where they're not allowed to be off their leashes. ||| It certainly makes you think about those times when you want to tell someone off or flip someone off. ||| Yeah, but there are practical concerns, like having to think up a new name for the puppy.  That's sort of an unnecessary burden, it seems. ||| Do you feel sorry for him because of what you think he'll feel after he does that? ||| I see.  Yeah, I guess I sort of don't understand the mentality of a guy like that, so I'm not sure I understand the situations when he'd use his gun.  I thought the most peculiar sentence in the article was when they said they walked by the two dog owners and one of the people (presumably the wife) apologized for their loss.  That just seemed wildly strange and ironice. ||| Absolutely.  I think that's right.  But it's so unbelievable, why bother to even say it.  I'm sort of surprised the dog owner didn't lose her mind.  Maybe she was scared of getting shot herself.  And she was also focused on her dying dog, of course. ||| I saw a woman's child get run over by a car once.  The child was lying in the street (long story) and the car's tire went right over its abdomen.  The woman's first instinct was not to check on her child, who was still under the car, but to bang on the guy's windows to complain.  I thought that was interesting. ||| I agree, but I would have thought her motherly instinct would have been to focus on the child first.  Apparently not. ||| Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a nice day.  bye ||| Migration of species always seems to create some sort of problem. ||| Yeah, that's pretty typical.  I think we're usually pretty responsible for this type of thing.  Invasive species, habitat destruction, etc. ||| I'm curious about where the amphibians fit into the food chain and whatever in those areas.  I guess small birds and rodents maybe eat them or something.  And they of course eat bugs and stuff. ||| Talking about mosquito populations would certainly get me to take this issue seriously. ||| Yeah, I don't mind frogs.  I see them when I go for walks at night and they sometimes scare me because they look like rocks on the road and then they shockingly start moving.  But of course they're just frogs. ||| That's a great childhood memory.  I used to catch little fish in tide ponds, although they were real fish. ||| Yeah, I think we forget that we're part of the whole natural world and are subject to all these things as well.  This is what happens to species.  They're exposed to new things and they adapt or die.  We're better at adapting to things, but we're still part of that system. ||| Yeah, there will always be something that crops up and threatens us.  And at the same time we're worried about other species too.  We've certainly got a lot of balls in the air. ||| Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, those bugs are scary.  But we haven't succumbed to any major pandemic or epidemic in a while.  So I just have no idea what the likelihood of any of these bugs wiping out major portions of the population are, like Spanish flu and the plague once did. ||| Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye ||| It's definitely an issue that's existed forever and I wonder whether it can truly change. ||| I'm afraid that it's also become such a contentious issue that it's hard to even trust allegations anymore when they're in the political sphere.  Which is very sad for people who do experience actual harassment. ||| Sure, although the person you're referring to also makes a lot of boasts and claims that are not true, so who's to say that wasn't just him bragging.  I'm just saying that every time there's a false allegation, and there are, it undermines the credibility of every single woman who legitimately experiences it. ||| The other thing about these issues is that we just seem to cycle through them and then lose interest and go onto something else.  Sexual harassment, blacks getting shot by cops, mass shooting, something Trump has done, North Korea or Russia or China, and then back to someone being sexually harassed.  It's just weird how quickly these issues come and go and then come back again, seemingly with no progress, just more ire. ||| Sure.  But are they being helped now?  I guess that's the question.  All of our consternation and anger--is it genuinely improving people's lives?  That's a complicated question, of course.  And certainly some people's are.  I just wonder what the net effect is. ||| Certainly could be.  Do you think the net effect of the metoo stuff (apropos this article) has been positive? ||| That's probably true.  Do you think there are any downsides? ||| That's good.  That's a start. ||| That's true. ||| Not that I'm aware of.  But I don't have social media accounts, which is where I'm most likely to see that type of thing. ||| Do you know anyone who's been part of it? ||| I'm not surprised they don't report it.  I'm sure there's a lot of fear and shame involved.  I do think it's an impediment to this issue being handled properly though.  If men are going to be held accountable, accusations can't come 30 years later. ||| Any other thoughts on this issue?  I'm mostly tapped out, I think. ||| (Nice one!)  Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| I'm glad the lady was found otherwise she might have been in serious trouble out in the cold. ||| Yes.  I assume she is mentally ill or has dementia, or was maybe just under the influence of something.  Her family must have been very worried. ||| I wonder if this kind of thing is happening more often now.  People are living longer and maybe more people are forced to take care of elderly or sick relatives at home. ||| Yeah, I think so too.  I'd rather meet a swift end than have my brain deteriorate.  My grandfather had Alzheimer's.  It's hard on everyone. ||| Yeah, it's definitely hard to relate.  I imagine they experience a lot of confusion and fear associated with not knowing what's going on. ||| Wow, that's a wild thought.  I can't even imagine what that would be like.  I also don't envy all the people who work in facilities to take care of dementia patients.  Those people are saints. ||| I think there's probably already a shortage of these types of workers, and it will only get worse going forward.  Old folks homes and that type of thing are a massive industry now.  We used to just put our elderly in the attic. ||| Back to this story, it's still nice to see that there's help out there in various forms.  Police get a bad rap these days but they still do plenty to help people.  And we focus on negative events and people, but there's still no shortage of people willing to help others.  We still have \communities\"" whether we recognize it often or not."" ||| Yes, for sure.  And I'm sure in the short term she's well taken care of.  But the family (assuming she lives with her family) will likely struggle with her for many more years, unfortunately. ||| Yes, I think it's complicated, and not least of all costly.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye ||| That's a heckuva lot of refugees heading towards Europe! ||| I was curious how the deal with Turkey has decreased numbers in that path to Europe.  I wonder how Turkey is slowing/stopping the migration. ||| The article described the three paths the migrants are using to get to Europe.  Basically Western Africa, which isn't a lot, Libya/Central Africa, and then through Turkey.  But it said that a deal had been made between Greece and Turkey (I think), to limit that number, suggesting Turkey was keeping migrants from moving through their country and into Greece/Europe.  Sort of like the US is asking Mexico to prevent migrants from C. America to move through their country and into ours.  I was just curious how Turkey was accomplishing this. ||| Yeah.  I'd think that once the migrants got into Turkey it would be harder to do anything about them.  Either way this is a big challenge for Europe. ||| Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or if there is one.  Certainly it has to do with reforming these peoples' home countries.  That's where the problem starts, of course.  But how to do that. ||| Yes, I can't imagine growing up in environments like Syria.  I wonder what the long-term repercussions are for the health and well being of children raised there, whether or not they're forced to flee. ||| Yeah, that's an interesting point.  I'd never thought of that.  I'd certainly be devastated losing someone close, so i could definitely see myself being hesitant to get close to people. ||| Indeed.  I wonder what birth rates are like in these countries while these things are going on.  And what the birth rates are like for refugees once they get to a new country where they feel safe.  Not sure it's important, just curious, I suppose. ||| I'd certainly hope that living in a warzone would give people pause, but who knows.  I never put it past people to have children they probably would be better off not having. ||| I'm amazed that Germany agreed to take 1 million refugees.  I wonder what the reaction in Germany was like. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good weekend.  bye ||| The thing I remember most about Janet Reno is Will Ferrell playing her on Saturday Night Live. ||| Actually, I'm just kidding.  I remember her for her actual job.  She was a very high profile Attorney General.  A lot of really big events took place in the 1990s with her involved. ||| She certainly didn't get out of her job with a squeaky clean reputation. ||| That's a good question.  I suppose it depends on who you ask.  But it was post-Cold War and Clinton didn't do much overseas, so it was mostly domestic stuff.  Clinton scandals, domestic terrorism, and a good economy.  I guess those are the things I remember. ||| What's the 92 crime bill talk? ||| Okay.  Do you think the crime bill was driven by malice or just ignorance? ||| So do you think that pretty much anyone who got to those positions would corrupt and do sketchy or even illegal things? ||| Yeah.  I also tend to think that the rare person who WOULD remain truly ethical and pure would never rise to the heights of national office.  I don't think they'd ever get there in the first place.  You have to be more ruthless and self-serving than that. ||| Yes, it certainly seems like a rich-get-richer type system at this point.  Oh well, at least everyone, including apparently Janet Reno, eventually dies.  That's gotta be some relief.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Have a great day.  bye ||| Yes, I thought the article showed quite a broad range of experiences.  People trying to survive the incident itself.  People finding out and dealing with dead loved ones.  People angry about it.  Officials trying to maintain safety and order going forward. ||| For sure.  I thought the portrayal of the father was quite poignant.  I found him to be quite reflective and I could really feel his suffering. ||| I also wondered about the guilt of the band playing that night.  Angels of Death Metal, I think they were called.  Imagine being the band that night, who advertised for people to come, wanted people to come, and then they were subjected to terror because of it.  They'll have to live with that guilt their whole lives, I'm sure. ||| The other thing that stood out was the description of people hiding and listening to gunfire for like 3 hours.  Starting and stopping.  That would be terrifying. ||| I'm sure a lot of people have PTSD from that event. ||| I sort of felt ambivalent about them saying they repaired the site and removed any traces of the incident.  On one hand I understand that. on the other I guess I felt like, to some extent you don't want to forget.  You want to admit what happened so you can acknowledge you survived it. ||| I also wondered what the increased governmental powers that were mentioned referred to.  Sort of like the US with the Patriot Act after 9/11.  A lot of how France reacted seemed pretty consistent with how the U.S. responds. ||| No, I don't think they mentioned specifics.  I wondered if it was something akin to Marshall Law, like curfews or just the power to search people or something. ||| I think we've been pretty good at preventing this type of terrorism (I'm ignoring domestic terrorism/mass shootings) for a while.  Hopefully that's a sign we can police it or that the forces behind it are being defeated or something. ||| Yes, it was nice talking to you.  I agree, this is something we'll have to be diligent about for a long time.  Have a good day, too. bye ||| Always sadder to experience these events from the perspective of individual people, like the father, I think. ||| And also the terror that one guy made me feel as he and others hid in the balcony and listened to the gunfire for three hours. ||| They didn't talk about it, but I'd feel terrible if I was the band playing that night.  I'd feel like I'd encouraged people to come to this event and then many of them died and all were traumatized. ||| We haven't had one of these big terrorist acts (ignoring domestic mass shootings) in a while it seems.  In Europe or here.  Hopefully that means we're getting better at policing them, or the terrorists are dwindling in numbers or resources or sometihng. ||| Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Maybe that thing in California where that couple used assault rifles and stuff to shoot at their coworkers or whatever it was. But that was a few years ago, I think. ||| And even that was a peculiar thing because I think they'd been here so long.  I get the feeling that it's gotten very hard to get explosives and things necessary for anything more than single people shooting or running over people.  And even then we're not seeing those types of attacks. ||| But yeah, we've got plenty of domestic incidents to be concerned about regardless. ||| Yeah, although I'd encourage you to keep it in perspective. You'd be as likely to win Powerball as to be the direct victim of one of these things.  Though both events are technically possible. ||| Okay, well that's good.  I'm not too big on crowds myself. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| Yes, this is a pretty vile story.  Truly disgusting. ||| I'm not sure what the solution is but I certainly feel no sympathy for however ISIS is wiped out. ||| Yeah, and I'm not actually sure what their strength is at this point.  Their influence outside the region certainly seems limited. ||| I sometimes wonder about the general temperament of some of these populations.  In the US we went to war against our \oppressors.\""  At what point do these middle eastern populations get fed up with dictators and other oppressive groups?  The people have plenty of guns.  They can form militias too.  I'd rather go down fighting than just be executed in the street."" ||| Yeah, that could certainly be the case.  Many forces and a lot of history acting on the people in these places, I guess. ||| Yeah, it's probably pretty futile.  The issues are long-standing and complicated and oftentimes we don't fully understand them. ||| It's also sort of interesting how we've been allies and enemies of the same groups at different times.  So in many ways there aren't always good guys and bad guys, clear and simple. ||| I just hoped that trying to establish democracy in the region, like in Iraq, would give the people a greater sense or power and responsibility for their own fates.  But maybe that was too much to hope for.  Look at Russia.  They get out from under the burden of communism and many want to return to it, and they're happy with a de facto dictator like Putin. ||| Yeah, it's a mess.  I guess I'm thankful I live in this part of the world.  We find a lot to complain about, but it could certainly be worse. ||| My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and is counting down the days until he leaves. ||| yeah, see ya.  bye ||| Syria is a real mess. ||| Yes, that would be surreal and very frightening.  Interesting that it didn't get followed up by the bombing that was warned about. ||| For sure.  Civil wars are interesting.  Wars usually end faster when you fight them indiscriminatly, but in a civil war you don't want to completely destroy your own country. ||| I think they're all bad.  That's part of the problem.  But with meat at $40 per kilogram, they're probably all pretty cranky. ||| I wonder who's even bringing that meat in in that situation. ||| Yeah!  I hadn't thought of that.  Maybe it's just stray cats or something.  That would make more sense. ||| For sure.  I almost always say that to myself at some point during the article: \We complain a lot in the West but man... it could be worse.\"""" ||| Yeah, the amount of people uprooted and trying to find new countries is remarkable.  I suppose it makes some sense with our technology making the world smaller (seemingly, if nothing else).  But in the Middle East, Africa, Central america.   Just amazing the number of people trying to find a new home. ||| Yeah, I agree.  But it's hard to know what the right answers are.  Like, I don't think we can just deal with the symptoms, which are refugees and that kind of thing.  That doesn't fix things in the long term.  But the real cause of these symptoms is stuff happening in sovereign countries, so we can't necessarily directly deal with them. ||| Yeah, I'd certainly like to see it get better for everyone, even if I have no idea how that'll happen. ||| Yeah, we could probably handle that.  Anyway, nice chatting with you today.  Have a good one.  bye ||| Obnoxious in what sense? ||| Yeah, but the media's pretty good at that, aren't they?  I don't think Trump creates anger and hatred.  He might embolden it.  Maybe.  But it already exists and is a function of our society, not one man. ||| I also sympathize fully with people who are furious after terrorist attacks.  I personally wouldn't go harass or assault an innocent person because of it, but I understand the feelings behind it, even if I don't condone the behavior. ||| Yes, I don't want to present too cynical and callous a view.  People can form stable societies.  But our current one likes to highlight differences and perceived inequalities, and that feeds a very antagonistic culture.  I think we know too much about each other, see too much that other people have that we don't, and it creates unrealistic expectations about how the world can possibly work.  We don't all get to have what we want.  Few, or none, do ||| Yeah, don't feel bad about ripping on social media.  I think it's a real problem.  Or, as you say, it heightens all these problems.  I think it's a real problem and will be interested to see how things unfold going forward, whether people start turning away from it or they double down and more of our lives gets filtered through our screens.  The problem is it's addictive for people, among other things, and I think that makes it harder for people to decide not to use it, even when they know it makes them unhappy. ||| Yeah, I was the same.  I don't even have a cell phone myself.  I'm annoyed that so few people are now in the phone book.  Some places apparently don't even have phone books anymore. ||| For sure, great chatting with you.  I enjoyed it and appreciate your perspective.  Have a great day.  bye ||| Not lookin' good in Venezuela! ||| Right, I feel for them too.  Venezuela is a very wealthy nation because of its oil reserves, and yet its people are starving because of dictatorial corruption.  What can you say. ||| Yeah, that's wild.  And what was the number they said for what they're spending on school lunches/  $0.0007 per lunch of something stupid. ||| Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  At what point is there real revolution?  Better to get killed fighting to live than just to expire.  But I don't know what all is going on, and I know millions have already fled. ||| True, although we had a revolution with guns, too.  I also think there's probably a different mindset in a communist country.  Those people have been dependent on their government; it's very counterintuitive to fight against the hand that's fed you. ||| I guess, but again, what's the difference between starving to death and getting shot?  At what point do you try to take control of your own situation? ||| Agreed, and I'm pretty sure we won't.  Or if we do, it certainly won't be because of the same causes as they are in Venezuela. ||| Yeah, I think there's a big difference between having one meal per day that requires standing in food lines, and not being able to afford the smartphone you want. ||| Yeah.  I also wondered how long these families keep sending their kids to school at all.  At what point is mere survival more important. ||| Oh well, hopefully this gets better.  And at some point I guess it will.  I'm not sure how it looks when it does, but oppression and tyranny don't last forever. ||| Yeah, I imagine every day is a lifetime.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye ||| Yes, although I'm not sure it was local governments, just local villagers.  Still, that must have been a horribly frightening experience. ||| Yes, I'm not sure.  The whole article was a little sparse on details, which I would have appreciated.  It didn't explicitly say what the villagers were angry about, although one could guess.  And I also wondered who called for the helicopter.  Seems unlikely the rangers would have survived that scenario, but who knows. ||| Yes, the fact that he escaped seemed incompetent, unfortunately.  But of course that's a large part of the story.  There aren't enough resources or competence to properly deal with the issue.  And there's probably corruption, too. ||| Yes, I think that's one of the tacks governments are taking is to focus on the demand.  Not sure how well it's worked but they're definitely putting pressure on things like ivory demand, maybe similar to same way that there's sort of a backlash against blood diamonds.  I was curious what animals were being poached in this story.  I don't believe it said, did it? ||| Yes, I think it's particularly disheartening when the story is of the authorities losing the battle.  I guess I feel like if nothing is currently being done to stop it, then there's the distinct possibility that change can and will happen.  But if they're already trying and failing, then it feels less likely to me that things can improve. ||| Yes, I certainly think that's part of it.  I'm curious what will happen to the people in the village?  The article is concerned about the cowardly police officers, and I get that.  But will there be any charges brought to the villagers for nearly killing the rangers?  I'd like to know that. ||| Yeah, if nothing else I'd certainly be nervous to be the guy sent there, seeing how they treated these rangers.  I feel like you'd probably have to convince people associated with poaching that there's an economically viable alternative to their poaching.  The problem is that I'm not sure what that is in Mozambique. ||| Yes, that's certainly an idea.  I think it's just human nature.  It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  We can entertain ideas of democracy and harmony and enlightenment and whatever, so long as we're fed and clothed and housed.  But if our basic needs aren't being met, we're going to scrap and claw for what sustains us, broader society and the world be damned. ||| Yes, I appreciated your perspective.  It made me think.  Thanks for taking the time to chat.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| Yes, that seems like quite a lot.  I'm guessing it was from an air strike for it to be that many. ||| These wars where we try to isolate the enemy and spare the civilians drag on and on.  Guerilla wars and insurgent wars. ||| Yes, it's hard to imagine what that would be like to live in a warzone.  It's one thing to sign up to do that.  But when one comes to you it's another story. ||| Those were two very experienced and relatively high-ranking troops.  Interesting that it wasn't lower ranking people, who are more plentiful.  Although maybe the operation was skewed because it was a joint exercise. ||| It is a tough question about what to do with these places, however.  If we leave I doubt the government will hold up to Taliban forces. ||| Right, we have to make decisions from where we stand, unfortunately. ||| I sort of feel like we shouldn't enter wars unless we're willing to fight them all-out.  Wars like WWII are brutal, but they end.  If you try to fight wars with one hand tied behind your back, it's unfair to your own troops, and it doesn't usually result in resolution. ||| I think they said we're going to start decreasing troop numbers in Afghanistan.  I'll be very interested to see what happens to that country whenever we leave.  I imagine it won't be good.  But at this point I'm not sure there's any good solution. ||| It's also possible that the Taliban, in whatever form it currently takes, is mostly pissed off about U.S. presence, and if we leave they could theoretically make some attempt to reconcile with the Afghan government.  But who knows. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye ||| This refugee issue seems to be a big deal in many parts of the world. ||| If nothing else I think countries that are likely destinations for large groups of refugees should decide, democratically, how they want to deal with them.  But those decisions need to be made before thousands are standing on your doorstep. ||| Sure, I think it should definitely be recognized that the refugees have no inherent right to what they're seeking.  Countries have every right to take none of them and send them away, to apply elsewhere or just to go away. ||| Absolutely.  We live by laws and borders, for the betterment of the most.  We have to keep doing that.  And I think a nation's and a government's first responsibility is to its own people.  As I say, I'd like a democratic process to decide how countries deal with these issues.  Let the people decide whether they want masses of refugees coming in. Why isn't that the people's say? ||| I'm curious as to where these refugees were from.  They were staying in Calais, which is in NW France, across from the UK.  It said their homes were burning.  That seems like a weird place for a refugee camp, or for people to be coming as refugees. ||| Yes, it certainly could Africa.  I also thought it was interesting that France promised space for 12,000 and then cut it off before that.  I wonder what prompts such a decision. ||| Yes, certainly could be that.  Again, another reason why I think the people's input should happen before government starts dealing with these large groups. ||| Yeah, I don't know.  But I fear it's going to be a bigger and bigger problem as transportation and communication become easier and make people, including large groups, more mobile ||| I think it's also easier for them to see other lifestyles and cultures and understand that there are better lives elsewhere.  That encourages them to flee. ||| Absolutely.  We have to have laws, whether people like recognize that or not.  People would not prefer true anarchy.  Anyway, good chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| Hi, I feel awful about this story.  What a terrible thing to happen to a police dog. ||| I wonder what happened.  If it was willful negligence or just a really \bad accident\"" as the sheriff said."" ||| I agree, but I wonder what the procedure is for taking the dog out of the car.  I mean, there must be times when the cops have to get out to attend to something and have to leave the dog inside. ||| Wait, was it 38 hours for the Arkansas one?  The other one was 5, I think.  But yeah, if it was 38 hours then he must have just forgotten the dog in the car, which is absurd. ||| Yeah, maybe that was it.  Those numbers are definitely correct that you just mentioned.  I just don't remember how long the dog was in the car.  But I bet that cop is ashamed to show his face at the precinct now (although he's currently on leave). ||| Maybe he was punishing the dog or was sick of him or something.   I think those dogs live with their handlers. ||| Yeah, I don't get it, whether it was intentional or unintentional.  That hurts the police force, too.  Those dogs aren't easy to come by and I'm sure the officers love having one on the force. ||| Yeah, that's part of the reason I said this guy must be ashamed to see his fellow officers.  He just killed a partner, valuable resource and protector of them. ||| Did you ever lose a dog?  I did when I was younger.  She got lost and I dreamed about her every night for a month.  It sucked. ||| Wow, yeah, that would have devastated me.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Dogs certainly become members of the family and it's awful to lose them. ||| Yes, nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  goodbye ||| Boy did that guy get dealt a bad hand in life. ||| I really feel terrible about the described events of his childhood.  To be adopted by people who then abused him.  Just disgusting, infuriating, and completely nonsensical to me. ||| Yes, for sure.  Amazingly, he seems to be taking it in stride. ||| Yeah, it would be surreal.  I'm glad Congress has worked to correct this issue to some degree so that negligent parents and/or adoption agencies can't deny the adopted child citizenship. ||| Well I think both his adoptive families abused him; that was most of his problem. The citizenship/deportation issue is one thing, but the thought of abusing little children, particularly an adopted one, is what really makes me sick about this. ||| And I'm sure the abuse is a large, if not the entire, reason why he got into criminal behavior, which is the real reason he's being deported. ||| Yes, it sure feels that way.  But the system is probably limited in how much time and energy they can put into each individual case.  They likely don't have the manpower for that. ||| I understand, but in a country of 330 million people, sometimes you have to be a number or the whole machine seizes up and ceases to work. ||| But it's not feasible to do what you're saying.  Every court case would take months.  Do we just let everyone who commits a crime walk the streets freely for decades while we figure out how their mother treated them as a toddler? ||| Sure, I don't disagree with that.  Anyway, hopefully this guy finds that Korea provides a better life for him than America.  The US sure didn't give him one.  Maybe that's terribly wishful thinking, but there isn't anything else positive about this story. ||| Yes, it would be a surprise happier ending if it improved.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye ||| It wasn't a feel-good piece, that's for sure. ||| Yes, the idea of government forces raping and killing civilians and foreign workers is pretty terrible.  To be honest I don't really understand the Sudan situation. ||| Yeah, I feel like the UN often tries to intervene in these situations and doesn't seem to accomplish a whole lot.  But I don't know.  Maybe it would be significantly worse if they weren't there.  But it doesn't seem to be ending. ||| I can understand why Kenya is angry.  They're doing a lot to deal with the problem, from peacekeeping to refugees, and they get criticized in the process. ||| It's interesting that the rebel leaders aren't even in the country.  I'm not sure I'd keep fighting for a cause if the leaders ran away. ||| It's interesting we don't hear much about Sudan.  I guess we don't like to talk about things we aren't really willing to intervene in. ||| I just think there's also a lot of hypocrisy though.  We wag our finger at people and talk about human rights and all that, and then do very little in a situation like this. ||| Right, I certainly wouldn't either.  But if I'm not willing to do anything about something, I get off my high horse about it. ||| Yeah, and I admit, these are not simple or easy problems. ||| And a lot of resources and manpower, too, I think. ||| Yes, thanks for chatting.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| I had mixed emotions, I guess.  How about you? ||| I guess I'm not all that averse to the notion of limiting children's exposure to second-hand smoke through regulations.  But the explanation for why these people wanted to do it seemed bizarre.  To prevent children from seeing people smoke... I don't agree with that. ||| How do you feel about the dwindling space and opportunity you have to smoke?  Do you think you should be allowed to smoke anywhere?  I think it's certainly a mixed message we send about smoking.  It's legal.... only we don't want you to do it anywhere. ||| And how about from a more political perspective?  Do you think towns, for example, should have the right to basically tell you you can't smoke anywhere in public? ||| It depends.  That's kind of the point I'm getting to.  You can find precedent to justify banning smoking in public.  You can find precedent to not.  I was just curious what your take is as a smoker.  i'm not a smoker, but in most situations I'm not averse to the idea of people being allowed to smoke. ||| Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm sure that part of my attitude towards smoking is from experience.  I grew up with people smoking in public and around me, so it was never strange.  But people who grew up more recently view it very differently.  Think about how crazy it is to think that, not so insanely long ago, people could smoke on a plane.  It seems like another planet. ||| Yeah, in my lifetime I can't think of any.  When was public drinking outlawed?  That was probably legal at one time.  Times do change.  Drinking and driving wasn't always illegal.  And one of my family's first cars didn't have seatbelts.  And that was legal. ||| I wouldn't mind seeing some restrictions on cell phone use.  Civility would spike dramatically if people had to look at real people more often, I think. ||| Yeah, it's interesting how as a society we're up in arms about one addiction (smoking) while disregarding another one. ||| Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| I can't imagine what it would be like to lose my eyesight in an instant as an adult.  Must be very scary now for her. ||| Yes, Kashmir sees a lot of violence and unrest.  I was curious to know what exactly was going on when she got shot. ||| I thought the comment by the father was awful/hilarious.  That it would have been easier for him to deal with it had she been killed. ||| It certainly seemed a strange sentiment to me.  Admittedly there are a helluva lotta them over there. ||| I wonder how attractive the girl was.  Would be a shame if she were a real looker and is now blind. ||| Yeah.  She also wanted to be a doctor so she's probably a real pain-in-the-ass if you know what I mean. ||| Who do you think is at fault for the unrest in Kashmir?  I imagine it's Pakistan. ||| It's definitely a sea of brown, I'll give you that. ||| Parts of North America look like India at this point too. ||| You build a thriving civilization and then hand the keys over to the savages.  I don't get it. ||| What do you think will replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency? ||| Yeah, the only thing is that the rest of the world, particularly China, is so heavily invested in the US dollar.  Can they afford to let it be destroyed? ||| I certainly wouldn't mind going to war with Iran.  But our nation doesn't have the temperament for it, and it's why we'll be usurped in the world by China in short order. ||| Well, hopefully I'll be dead by then.  That's my hope.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  It's been illuminating.  Have a good day.  bye ||| Yes, these types of conflicts seem to be happening all over the place.  I don't fully understand any of them. ||| Indeed.  And there's usually some element of ethnic or religious conflict involved. ||| They definitely seem to be at the center of a lot of these issues.  And the UN is usually on the periphery, complaining a lot. ||| I agree.  I think the UN is embarrassing and self-righteous and accomplishes nothing.  I also think Burma has a right to run their own country how they like.  As someone in the article said, this is an internal matter, not an international one.  I tend to agree. ||| I guess I also feel little sympathy for these cultures that have existed for thousands of years and still haven't found a way to exist peacefully.  People get what they deserve, to some degree.  i guess I'm deterministic like that. ||| Yeah, it sort of works that way whether we intend it to or not. ||| Yeah, we spend too much time allowing the bottom 5% of our culture to dictate its direction and policies.  That seems perfectly upside down and stupid to me. ||| For sure.  Let's let some microscopic fraction of the population dictate to the huge majority, inconveniencing them and making everything far less efficient. ||| Yeah, and I fear we'll only continue further in that direction. ||| Yeah, that's a good point.  We'll get what we deserve.  Probably nothing too great. ||| Yes, nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  goodbye ||| I don't have a problem with us intervening.  It's really a proxy war between Iran and KSA. ||| Yes, they certainly have a tough go of it. But I think Saudi Arabia has a right to defend itself.  Their priority should be to their own citizens, not Yemeni citizens.  That's how I feel. ||| Yeah, it's hard to know what's going on there.  Sometimes I wonder how much of what we hear is just propaganda from either side. ||| I think it's strange what it said about the U.S. decreasing its advisors to the coalition.  The article said that was distance themselves from it.  But if they had problems with how it was operating, I'd think the better tack would be to increase advisors to have more control over how it's run. ||| Yes, that could be.  I just hope we can find a better way to fight these conflicts with terrorist and rebel groups.  We struggle with these small groups that are embedded in civilian populations.  And when we try to spare the civiliians it makes the job that much tougher. ||| Yes, that's a great point.  I think it's important to remember who started the fighting.  The coalition may not be responding effectively or compassionately, but they wouldn't be fighting at all had it not been the Iranian-backed rebels starting it all. ||| It will be interesting to see what happens now after that drone strike on Saudi oil facilities.  That's the country's lifeblood.  That's their entire existence.  They can't stand for that.  I wonder how they respond. ||| Yes, the response could be severe.  The country already is having financial problems, and that threatens the viability of the monarchy.  So they'll want to strike back hard.  What did it say that taxi driver had?  8 children?  I guess a lot of people in these conflict areas know what it's like to be orphans or lose loved ones. ||| Yeah, and Yemen is pretty isolated down there.  Can't even recall which countries they border, other than Saudi Arabia, who certainly doesn't want anything to do with them. Also, the region is mostly desert, which makes migration impossible in many directions. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you,too.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| I think war is a complicated thing.  It's too bad this father of eight died. ||| It's pretty messy for sure.  I'm not sure what's going to bring it to conclusion. ||| That attack on the Saudi oil production facility recently might change things.  That's a true existential threat to the monarchy and country if their oil production--which is their entire economy--goes down. ||| There was a recent drone attack on a huge oil facility in KSA that knocked out a huge amount of their production.  Like 50% or something enormous.  At first they said it was a drone strike from Yemen, but then there were accusations it came from Iran itself, or from people inside KSA.  Either way it's backed/supported by Iran, and it's something the Saudi monarchy cannot tolerate if they want to survive, because the stability of their entire country depends on oil production.  So I wonder how they'll respond.  Saving individual Yemeni cab drivers realistically should not be their priority when millions of Saudis existences are at stake. ||| How does sitting back and taking incoming from Iranian-backed Yemenis, or Iran itself, improve things? ||| Maybe in the short term.  In the long term KSA needs to defend itself.  War has solved problems in the past, whether you want to admit it or not. ||| Yeah, it would be very unpleasant to live in such an environment.  We take for granted the relative stability in our society. ||| I agree.  We could all use a different perspective at times.  If we turned off our TVs and phones and went outside we'd be amazed how pleasant the world seems compared to how we perceive it online. ||| And the thing is I think people understand that, at least on some level.  But like moths to a flame we seem drawn to things that make us anxious and upset and unhappy. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| Pretty awful incident to think about. ||| Sounds incredibly unlucky, too, in that it might have even started with a lightning strike. ||| Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there. ||| Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's probably pretty loosey-goosey I would think.  A type of lifestyle we don't experience. ||| Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images. ||| Yeah, for sure.  I think I'd be hesitant to buy fuel that way in the future, even if it's incredibly unlikely that something like that happens again. ||| For sure, and how quickly things can change.  No one could have anticipated that, and I'm sure friends and relatives will ask \why\"" for the rest of their lives."" ||| No, nothing close to that.  I've seen some gnarly car accidents, but those you sort of understand as human error and that type of thing.  Something like this is just totally bonkers. ||| Have you ever visited Africa, or Mozambique in particular? ||| Never.  My brother has visited a number of countries though, including Mozambique, which he very much enjoyed.  Anyway, nice chatting with you about a sad subject.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| That was a lot of diesel to dump into the ocean. ||| Yes, the herring and abalone in the area sound like they're in trouble. ||| Yes, I thought it was unfair to criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they were doing their best. ||| That's the NDP government for you though ||| Either way, it sounds like conditions were very difficult for the cleanup.  And that's a pretty remote area. ||| Yeah, that's an interesting question.  I really don't know.  That was a huge amount of diesel be carried by that tugboat though. ||| I know my dad loves pickled herring.  Hopefully this doesn't increase the price.  Not sure how much commercial fishing is done up there. ||| I also wonder how much of the Indians' diet is from seafood.  Might be a meaningful amount, although they also probably get a lot of stuff flown or shipped in as well. ||| Yeah, that would be absolutely terrible.  I'll be thinking about this one for a while. ||| Yeah, well it's not the type of issue that makes big headlines, and it's in a remote area. ||| Yes, nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| I thought it was sad.  I've never understood pointless cruelty or destruction like this. ||| Yeah, I can't even imagine what was going through the guy's head.  Although I've read that people hurting animals at the zoo isn't all that uncommon. ||| Hopefully pretty severe.  But yeah, I have no idea what \animal cruelty\"" charges bring."" ||| For sure.  I also wonder how/why they thought they'd get away with it.  There must have been a lot of people around. ||| Yes, whether it's as a species or as individuals, we tend to be pretty destructive, even sadistic at times. ||| I tend to agree.  I think it's part of our makeup.  We'll always keep striving for dominance and control, over each other and nature. ||| Yeah, that's terrible.  Again, I just don't understand it.  Does it make people feel powerful or tough or something?  Or maybe they're just sadists. ||| For sure.  I'm sure that's part of it.  I bet the zookeepers at the Busch Gardens are absolutely distraught.  I'm sure they develop close bonds with all those animals. ||| My grandparents used to live in Florida.  Never went to a Busch Gardens but we went to alligator farms and stuff like that.  Always loved seeing animals.  Hopefully they were all treated well. ||| Yes, it was nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| Fighting over Kashmir has been going on for decades and doesn't seem to be ending soon. ||| They're both nuclear powers so that makes the tensions more meaningful, though they've refrained from using nuclear weapons to this point. ||| I guess I feel like I don't know enough about the back-and-forth.  I fully believe that terrorist groups exist in Pakistan.  And I think India has a right to defend itself. ||| Indeed.  I'd guess they're typically the cause of any escalation in tensions. ||| Yes.  Pakistan has a very bad history of harboring terrorists.  And I'm sure there are plenty of radical folks who would like to actively fight India. ||| I'm sure there will continue to be skirmishes like this.  But an all-out war between these two countries would be massive, with the potential for nuclear strikes.  I doubt we'll see something like that in our lifetime. ||| I suppose, but I think there's a difference between casting a ballot for someone and entering into an existential war.  Look at Putin.  He's ruthless.  He hasn't fought a large-scale war.  Everything now is skirmishes and proxy wars and terrorism and stuff like that. ||| I thought the last line of the article was sort of funny, that Bollywood directors aren't hiring Pakistani actors because of this.  Just thought that was a sort of trivial way to end the article. ||| Although that may be what the majority of Indian people care most about.  Who knows.  In the US we'd spend a lot of time concerning ourselves with what actors were saying on Twitter. ||| I guess this article makes me feel better about my life. I don't fear rockets coming in from Canada. ||| Absolutely.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye ||| Yes, it was a pretty grisly image it portrayed of what happened to the kitten. ||| Yeah, they were clearly trying to influence people to join their cause for justice and animal equality. ||| Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here. ||| Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim. ||| Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea? ||| Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.  In this case it would be interesting to see if the citizens track down the culprit. ||| I suppose it depends on where the kitten came from.  If someone had a litter and gave them away it could be found out.  Either way I don't really care. ||| I agree.  I feel sad at the thought of a tortured cat.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over a dead cat, just like I don't break down when I see a squirrel squished on the road. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye ||| How do you feel about cops punching women? ||| I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop. ||| Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me. ||| Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops. ||| Imagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly. ||| Yeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person. ||| Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science. ||| Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent. ||| Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful. ||| Yeah, have a great day.  Nice chatting with you.  goodbye ||| Seems like a tragic accident or misunderstanding. ||| Definitely.  I can't imagine what was going through the minds of the Americans not stopping at the gate. ||| The families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training. ||| Wow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was? ||| Wow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face. ||| Yes, there's definitely a lot of that, unfortunately.  Although I've also known a lot of people who were in the military who got a ton out of it and are thankful for their time in. ||| It definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army. ||| Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types. ||| That's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  bye ||| How did this article make you feel? ||| Not really.  I'd be interested to know how they feel about Trump now seeing as he's been such a pro-Israel President. ||| I'm part Jewish but have never had that much connection to Jews or understanding of their feelings on their place in our society. ||| It's just  not a big part of my family tree. ||| Yeah, sort of like slavery for blacks. Now everything gets viewed through that prism.  Jewish history has plenty of persecution before that too. ||| The thing is though that I don't think Trump himself has ever done anything anti-semitic.  Certainly people who voted for him have. ||| Maybe, but I don't think his message exactly gets through when it's filtered through the media.  I thought Trump's response to Charlottesville, for example, was the correct one.  Both sides were at fault. ||| Yes, you're allowed to be wrong. ||| Yeah, it wasn't hard.  Any other thoughts on this article?  Do you think our democracy is being threatened by a Presidential election? ||| I'm not sure what you mean. ||| I think you're confused about a lot of what's going on. ||| Yeah, it's always nice chatting with someone who's mentally retarded.  bye ||| What did you feel about the article? ||| Yes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience. ||| Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.  And it's because of how we communicate and interact with each other, not some fundamentally new divide in ideology or something. ||| Yeah, it's pretty awful.  I don't use it (although I'm so asocial in wouldn't do anything for me anyway).  But I think it's interesting because everyone seems to be coming to the same conclusion that it's bad, but they can't stop themselves from using it nonetheless. ||| Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade. ||| Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then. ||| Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care. ||| Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems. ||| I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now. ||| Yes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.  Always nice talking with reasonable, thoughtful people.  Have a great day.  bye ||| Yeah, that should certainly tell you something.  (Although he was willing to unleash it on the world.)  Anyway, good chatting again.  bye ||| Yes, it seems like it would be terrifying to be in a train derailment. ||| For sure.  I always think of trains as very safe modes of transportation.  It would be shocking to hear a loved one died on a train. ||| I'm always puzzled about how derailments can occur.  Do the trains go too fast or are the tracks damaged or something?  I never understand it. ||| Have you ever been on a long train ride?  I've only ever been on subways and light rail. ||| haha! What it is about the subway that scares you?  Being underground? ||| Gotcha.  I can definitely see that.  They're also usually very dark and often extremely crowded.  I rode one to work for a few years.  Wasn't the best part of my day. ||| Yeah, I'm sure it was totally out of the blue.  Even though planes are safe, I think you always have in the back of your mind that at any time something could go terrible wrong in the air.  But a train?  It's gotta be unexpected. ||| Yeah, I'm sure they do a thorough evaluation and fix whatever was wrong.  Europe uses trains a lot more than we do, I think.  They can't afford to let things get into disrepair. ||| Let's hope it doesn't happen too frequently in the future. ||| Yes, nice chatting with you too. ||| goodbye ||| I would prefer that people not feel the need to kill themselves.  That would be my hope for people.  How about you? ||| Do you agree with doctor-assisted suicide?  Do you think that should be legal? ||| I believe it's now legal in Canada.  Do you think there will be a push in the U.S. (I assume you're in the U.S.) to legalize it here? ||| Yes, they're certainly more progressive.  It's just not an issue we hear much about here.  Suicide talk nowadays tends to focus on young people, which has apparently spiked. ||| Yeah, I totally forgot about him.  I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall. ||| I'll have to go back and read about him.  Seems strange that he thought he could get away with doing that.  But maybe I don't remember the specifics of what he did and what the laws were. ||| Yeah, it's certainly a complicated issue.  And if I were in his situation I certainly wouldn't have thought I could get away with it, even if he just felt he was enabling others to commit suicide.  But obviously he felt more passionately about it than I do. ||| Yeah, I always find it interesting.  I think people actually have the same values; they just weigh them differently in different situations.  What we're talking about is largely a conflict between freedom and order (maybe not the best word for it, but I'll use it anyway).  I believe in freedom of choice.  So do you and everyone.  You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values. ||| Sorry to hear about the ear infection.  Hope she feels better soon.  Nice talking with you, too.  Have a great day.  bye"
p063,"That's sad.  Regardless of what they find out happened, who was controlling what or if they had drugs in their system or whatever, it's sad.  I don't know that they will find out anything, i just feel like lots of people will turn this into something it's not.  It's unfortunate anytime a young person like this, with the world at their fingertips, loses their life in something that was controllable. ||| I guess I just feel bad for these people.  Losing your home to a fire has got to suck.  Not only did you lose everything you love and own in the blink of an eye, but let's be honest, it was probably your fault.  Usually fires start because you were doing something you weren't supposed to, or there was shoddy work completed. ||| I can't believe having to go through that.  It's shocking that in a fairly developed world this is still going on.  What's even more shocking is that it sounds like this is probably fairly common in the area.  For the police and authorities to clearly not care about it suggests that it is considered to be a non issue. ||| This whole situation kind of blows.  On one hand, I hate that what we might be doing is infringing on people sacred land.  On the other hand, I remember reading about how they gave the pipeline an x amount chance of spilling into the water, and it was relatively low.  I just don't know who I support here.  I don't think people should be burning cars, and blocking roads, but I don't really have an alternative plan either. ||| I feel really bad that this is happening to people out there trying to protect the wildlife.  i'm not sure exactly what happened, but it seems like these poachers are paying off the policemen, and the locals to protect their livelihood.  It is unfortunate that the people can't protect their own area, but they are probably poor, and consider the money necessary. ||| After reading that article, I'm not sure woh the good guys are.  it sounds like the rebels might be the better people, but who knows.  It sucks that the UN is so strapped when it comes to helping in times like this.  I hate to say it, but it just seems like sometimes people are better off leaving countries to their own wares (sp?). ||| I guess that i feel really bad for these people, but it also makes me hate islam even more.  you jsut don't see this in the civilized world, but you see it so often in places spurred on by radical islam.  I hope they afigure it out.  i don't know what the solution is, but these types of things will always happen. ||| These people are freaking weird.  Im sorry but the whole concept of wearing blood around your neck is so annoying on so many levels.  Not only are you being overly dramatic in an effort to further your career and notoriety, you're also just being downright freaky and cutting yourselves.  I don't get these people. ||| Polar bears just can't catch a break man.  It sucks that in almost every possible way, we are just ocmpletely screwing the polar bears over.  I would like to see what the cause of the bears dying is?  Are the tourists themselves killing them?  Are there bear attacks, and so police have to put them down? ||| I really hate hearing news like this.  It seems like every time you turn around you're hearing a new story about how the world is killing itself.  I'm not sure I needed to hear about all the specifics as to why seabirds are eating plastic, but it definitely hurts to see that it's going on.  The real kicker is the stat at the end about how pollution is going to rise by 80% in the next six years. ||| I wonder when this kind of stuff will stop.  While I do believe that there are many cases of abuse like this that occur.  All it takes are a couple of false accusations that destroy the fabric of the whole movement.  I'm sure this sound insensitive, but this new trend of people coming clean about harassment that occured decades ago, and is basically unprovalbe is getting old.  It's hard to believe people, particularly after the Kavanaugh case where I don't think the accuser was very believable. ||| This is kind of a sucky story.  As apart of my job, I run into these types of things all the time.  I think that they can go one of two ways.  Either they're drunk, and annoying and you want them out of your hair as  quickly as possible, or they're having a legitimate medial issue, and you want to help them.  It's tough because you want to thelp them, but with such limited information, it's hard to do so. ||| I feel bad for these people.  all they want is a better life for themselves or their families.  However, this global refugee issue is a serious problem.  Existing structures and camps aren't able to do the job because of the massive influx of people.  We need to correct the root cause of this problem, while also caring for the people. ||| I can't bleieve we're still dealing with this shit in Afghanistan.  I also really don't blame the peope there for developing a hatred of the US and the Western Powers.  With all these strikes ending up with their civilians dead, I would probably have animosity towards the invaders who only want my oil money, too. ||| I guess i hope those red squireels are going to be ok.  to be honest, i don't reallllyyy care thaaaat much, but I don't want to see them go.  I like keeping as many species of animals around as possible for our future generations to be in awe of.  It's unfortunate that humans keep fucking it up for native species.","Sad about what happened to those guys.  I hope no one makes this about alcohol or anything. ||| Right. I can't imagine being his family either.  To see their child go like that after being so successful has to sting. ||| I don't remember if it said so in the article or not, but was it night when they ran into the rocks? I just don't get why they didn't see them? ||| At least it was probably instant.  They probably had no idea the rocks were there and absolutely flew into them without any chance to realize what was going on. ||| Lol I think it would suck more to come out of a coma.  When you're in it you have no idea.  I would hate coming out of one and realizing you lost a month of your life or something. ||| I feel like there's lots of stories out there about people saying they saw everything but from the third person perspective or things like that. Other people say it was just the deepest sleep they've ever had. ||| For real.  Obviously they don't know everything about it, but it blows my mind when I watch docs or something where people are breaking down the parts of the brain... Like, how the fuck did we figure all this stuff out... ||| What do you do in the medical field? ||| Damn.  Sounds cool.  Do you just sit in on surgeries and assist? ||| Yeah I here ya, probably makes the operation flow a lot smoother when the surgeon asks for a tool and you're not fumblefuckin around looking to find the blahblahmeter. ||| what's the longest surgery you;ve ever taken part in? ||| Yikes.  Well if Jose would've survived he probaby would have needed at least an 8 hour spinal surgery. ||| bye. ||| Yeah, I suppose that is just the type of lawlessness that exists in these countries. ||| In these countries where Islam is prominent, it's kind of the wild west. ||| No, I was merely stating that in any of these middle east and north african countries, these types of events are common.  Just so happens Islam exists there. ||| Yeah, it's really terrible that some of the women were impregnated by their abusers.  I don't know how the woman's relationship with the baby will develop after that. ||| I'm not sure I noticed in the article, but was the camp strictly for women?  If there were male victims included in there, that wouldn't be a possibility. ||| Ideally, I think you're right, I just wonder what Nigeria's resources and capabilities are to provide for that. ||| I wasn't aware that Nigeria was so wealthy.  I still think wealthy is a relative term when comparing to other African nations.  Especially when you see the issues they're struggling against like this Boko Haram. ||| what does? breakups? ||| Oh right.  I feel like Billy should haev expected that seeing as how he married a gorgous movie star who was 20 years younger than him. ||| Lol I'm assuming you don't mean legally, although there probably should be... but my parents were 12 years apart, and that was kind of pushing it.  I feel like normal people shouldn't exceed 15 years.  You? ||| Yeah, there's just too many cultural obstacles to overcome, not to mention the difference in life stages.  My dad is retired, while my mom still has to work, it's kind of making things difficult. ||| Yeah.  Thing is though, I'm sure the majority of marriages in hollywood are done for almost purely professional reasons anyway..  I don't think these people actuallllyyy love each other . ||| Yeah that's doable, but anything more is still getting weird.  What do you think about the blood vial thing? ||| Yeah I just find that to be a publicity stunt.  Keeps their names in the news. ||| Yeah.  Do you think they're strange so they got into hollywood? Or are they strange because they got into hollywood? ||| Lol yeah you're probably right.  I'm sure there's a lot of Weinsteins, but concentrated on kids. ||| You probably just end up getting into crazy stuff because of their schedule, and ability to form meaningful relationships with other people. ||| Yeah you're really screwing with a kids brain when you put them in the limelight that early.  Not to bring basketball into it, but that's why I always appreciated Lebron James.   A star at an early age, yet he turned out to be a pretty stand up guy. ||| Yeah.  Thing is though, Lebron was a star at 13, and he's been faithfully married (as far as we know) to the same girl since like 20.  Can't say the same about Kobe. ||| LOL WE HAVE AN EXTREME DISAGREEMENT NOW! ||| He is far and away the better player.  Kobe is a volume shooter, and good defender, but Lebron is sooo much more efficient with the ball on offense, and his defense is clearly better than Kobe. ||| He was like a poor mans MJ.  Lebron however is a completely different player.  Unfortunately for Kobe too, the game isn't just decided in the last shot, it's decided by the other 100 before it as well. ||| Lol same here! goodbye ||| Losing your home in a fire has got to be pretty terrible. ||| I always feel bad when people lose animals.  They don't get the sympathy like someone would who lost family, but losing pets still hurts a lot. ||| yeah.  hopefully they get back on their feet quickly thougn. ||| Yeah that's true.  That must be a real kick in the pants if the cause of the fire was your own doing too, and the insurance company doesnt pay out. ||| Its tought that all their memories were lost with that house, at least with most other natural disasters, you get a chance to plan ahead. ||| If you could take three things from your house in the case of a fire, what would they be? ||| What is the cloth if you don't mind me asking? ||| You have any kids? ||| Lol nice.  Enjoy your time. ||| I've got one, and it looks like that'll be it. ||| bye ||| I feel like the Polar bears are getting screwed in every way imagineable.  If it isn't one thing getting em, it's another. ||| That's what I was wondering too.  Are the tourists actually the ones killing them, or are they getting attacked more, so officials have to kill the bears? ||| Yeah it's like, if we're not completely destroying their environment, we're gonna tour into whats left of it, and kill them that way.  Tough life for a Polar Bear. ||| I think other than the basics of respecting our environment, and voting in political candidates who would enact policies, I\m not sure there is much we can do."" ||| Lol I hope tourists aren't eating seal pups... I'm sure just the interaction ends with having to kill polar bears. I know that happens frequently where I'll go hiking.  There will be a bear attack, and officials then have to find and kill the bear, otherwise they'll attack more humans. ||| No, but I think humans have this innate feeling that the world is ours for the taking.  Not sure how we correct that though. ||| Yeah.  I watch a lot of BBC nature programs too.  I'm sure a lot of it is edited, but everytime they show footage of polar bears, you're left holding back tears. ||| Ha, as sad as that is though, that doesn't bug me. Circle of life shit.  That's how nature is supposed to be.  What bugs me is when you see how humans are disrupting the natural cycle of things, and other animals pay for it. ||| I've definitely been trying to do more the last several years.  It can get kind of depressing though when you realize what a small impact you can actually have. ||| I mean, you don't have any other choice in my opinion.  I try to get others to follow suit as well.  Grassroots type stuff.  I also try to ensure that I'm not overbearing about it though, I think that turns people off. ||| bye ||| I would have believed that there were abuses of human rights going on in situations like this, but holy crap, the accusations of the broken fingers and stuff is infuriating. ||| yeah, women still have it pretty tough in other places of the world. ||| Oh for sure.  I wonder if the families know that that's inevitable when they send their children to do this. ||| Yeah, but I wonder if there's hope that they'll land in a good place, and prosper? ||| Oo I guess I could understand that.  It's easy for us to say here in America, assuming that's where you're from, that we wouldn't do that. ||| That's kind of why I think travel is extremely important.  If you have the means to travel, you owe it to yourself to get out and see the world, see how other people live their life, and hopefully understand that there is more to this earth than your little bubble. ||| Lol, oh yeah we've become incredibly reliant on tech.  If that was yanked from under our feet, and we had to go back to working the earth, we're f'd. ||| I'm sure accusations like this occur all the time.  Maybe the police brush it off regularly?  The difference might have been that international journalists got involved. ||| Yeah I've been to several.  Italy, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Eleuthera. ||| In the last three it was pretty dismal compared to here.  Thing was though, they seemed happier.  It's funny how wealth doesn't really buy happiness. ||| Yeah, and the simple things that they do have gives them a lot of joy.  I played some basketball in Eleuthera, and they were freaking having a blast trying to dunk on the white boy. ||| Nah, just sucks to hear that this is still common for such a large people group. ||| bye ||| Yeah, I would have never guessed that the plastic gives off the same \scent\"" as food.  Weird."" ||| I think that statistic was misleading though.  From what I understand, they're the largest polluters, because we (the west) ship them all our trash. ||| I'm sure.  I think they also can't afford to have the same opinions as us.  In fact, I just remembered how one of those countries, perhaps Indonesia, just shipped back several thousands of tons of trash back to Europe, as they said they were shipped against their wishes. ||| I would rather see them change the root cause.  Less pollution.  I think we as americans have been turning a blind eye to these issues too long, and that needs to change. ||| Right.  So maybe we need to get away from one time consumables, and move to products that are biodegradable.  I know that this issue of paper straws, and no plastic bags is mocked quite often, but it's a movement that needs to happen. ||| Are you asking what defines my use of the word, \needs\""?"" ||| Well that is a question that would need to be answered at a different time, as there is waaay too much for this venue, but for starters, banning plastic straws should just be the start.  The plastics and oil industry is probably the most toxic thing to happen to this planet.  Plastics are in everything.  That not only creates pollution in the oceans, kills wildlife and changes ecosystems, but it is the primary contributor to global warming.  Too many people selectively listen to their bought and paid for politicians and lobbyists, and don't buy the conecpt of climate change, but oh well, I'll get off my soapbox ||| Not really.  I think too many people think the change needs to happen from up top, instead of themselves making the change.  I think most people don't understand that we vote/enact change with out wallets, and too many americans are too greedy to have any foresight, and concern themselves with any issue that don't take place in their immediate bubble. ||| Agreed.  I also think our brains have a difficult time comprehending things that don't occur in our experienced time frames.  Hearing time scales of thousands or millions or billions of years is something most people can't wrap their brains around, so when scientists bring up changes that are occuring, normal people shrug it off as something that will be overcome, or has already happened before. ||| bye ||| This whole situation just sucks.  I can see things from both parties perspectives.  I hope it gets cleared up without any casualties. ||| So you're saying the oil people should move the pipeline, or determine some other means of remedy? ||| That's probably true.  Divert it somewhere.  I wonder what the costs would be though?  We'll probably never know. ||| Possibly, whenever I see how the article states there are native americans, and protestors, it makes me wonder how much of this is a feigned movement by radical lefters. ||| Exactly.  I hate to get like this, but I don't trust a word from the media anymore.  They'll frame anything to get the point across that they want to. ||| True.  Either way you look at it, Native Americans have been getting shit on in this country for like 500 years. ||| I guess with that being said, maybe I am more in favor of them changing the pipeline somehow.  Even if there is just a small chance of leaking, maybe the NA's have been f'd with enough. ||| Yeah.  I wonder if any of the oil bigwigs have discussed that at all, or if they're just planning on ompletly muscling these people, knowing they have the support of the Government. ||| If I remember correctly, the land itself is owned by the government, but the problem would be if the the pipeline burst.  If that happened, oil would seep into the groundwater, and pollute the (sacred) lake that the NA's use. ||| That's true.  That would be a good olive branch.  Not only would they have jobs, but also maybe have an opportunity to ensure that the pipe is done well, and minmize any chance of pipe failure. ||| It would probably just be an issue of whether they have any of the qualifications.  I'm sure at least the labor jobs they could assist. ||| same to you! ||| bye ||| Honestly, I'm sure it sounds insensitive, but I'm tired of these. ||| Yeah and at this point, particularly after the Smollet, and Kavanaugh case, I just tend to doubt the accuser more.  Especially when the accusations are dated by decades. ||| I understand it form the other perspective too, maybe the name, such as Kavanaugh, becomes so huge in the news, that it infuriates you and you feel like you have to say something. I still just don't buy it though. ||| Yeah.  A lot of this supreme court stuff, I think the democrats saw the opportunity for the gop to take a massive majority in the court, and decided they had to take drastic efforts to curb that.  They were too eager to push this narrative, even though the evidence wasn't there. ||| Seriously.  Ok, this might be a little off the wall, but I think this is the human evolution catching up to society.  It used to be that man protected and hunted, women took care of kids, and were prized for their looks and maternal instincts.  Nowadays, woman have caught up to men in their working ability.  Men have to learn that women aren't their property anymore, and this is a dynamic that might take time to set in with the elitely wealthy. ||| Lol.  Every man's wildest fantasy includes a woman touching his butt unanounced.  But no, I don't think men and women are necessariliy equal in abilities and talents, I'm not one of those people. ||| I would assume only in the court of public opinion.  There would be a push to take away his seat.  Which is just another reason to think this was politially motivated. ||| Yeah I think the same thing sometime.  However, when you really think about it, the world could go completely south in the next few years, and still be leaps and bounds better than it was 200/500/1000 years ago. ||| Lol, I do however doubt humanity is going to be around for another thousand years.  I'm sure that we're going to find some way to eff things up in the next century or two. ||| yeah, I remember hearing couple years ago about how we've basically reached the limit that we can on processor speed or storage or something like that.  I wonder when that kind of thing will start to hit our other technologies. ||| Yeah it's like we had the industrial revolution, and maybe now we're nearing the end of the technological revolution.  But who knows... ||| lol yeah good talk. bye ||| yeah sounds like she had some serious medical problems.  wouldn't be this much hubbub if it was just a drunk person. ||| I saw that she was almost seventy.  In my line of work, you see a lot dementia or alzheimers patients tht get out of their house and wander. ||| Yeah, it's hard to blame the caretaker though.  There's a lot of people out there who are afraid of homes, and think they can take care of their spouse in their later years.  Gets difficult, and next thing you know George snuck his way out of the house while you were taking a shower. ||| There's a lot of people without family out there, and even then, caring for a mentally ill older patient can be incredibly difficult and time consuming. ||| If you have a job, that becomes impossible.  If you don't have a job, how do you make money? ||| Lol do you have any experience with this? Do you have any idea how expensive home health care nurses are?  Most people cannot afford those services, and even if you can, most home health care only show up for an hour a day.  To pay for help to watch your parent full time, while you work full time, would be pointless. ||| Look, this isn't even about caring for a parent, this is about caring for a parent, who also wants to wake up at 2 am, and head to the grocery store that doens't exist.  I'm aware that you think you've got it all figured out, but I can assure you, life with a spouse who has dementia is tougher than you think. ||| I'm not saying that you can't care for people, I just think blaming the caretakers for a sick old person getting out is kind of jumping the gun. ||| Well I agree with that. ||| True, just remember it isn't the will of a thirty year old we're talking about here a lot, it's a seventy something year old spouse who doesn't want to stop caring for their loved one.  But I hear ya. ||| That's definitely got to be one of those diseases that really affects the kids and spouses more than the patient themselves.  I couldn't imagine my wife or parents forgetting who I was, or the memories we shared. ||| I always love reading the news that they're close to finding a cure for alzheimers.  Hope that that'll never be something I deal with. ||| True. I'm sure a lot of them are just clickbait. ||| Yeah pretty good discussion! bye. ||| That's really terrible about the situation in Mozambique. ||| I wonder what the reasons for the community mob were?  I'll bet the poachers are paying off both the police, and the community. ||| Boy that's a tough place to be if you're a ranger?  Can't get any support.  I hope the government figures this out. ||| Yeah.  I've heard the more the animal population dwindles, the more expensive the items get.  Kind of makes the poachers try even harder.  Kind of a death cycle. ||| It's the civilized world's fault too.  Especially China, their the ones buying all the ivory and what not. ||| Yeah, as much as I'd hate to see it.  I wonder if it'd be better to just let these people have a bunch of rhinos to make a rhino farm, then they could just cut the horns off periodically?  Kind of like sheep and their wool? ||| ooo that's true. getting some fake rhino stuff on the market.  aren't rhino horns just like our fingernails or something? ||| Oh I see what you're saying.  I didn't know that they thought rhino horns had some sort of value other than for aesthetics. ||| Lol well I guess Americans think that about certain things too, they're just not endangered.  ie. horny goat weed... ||| lol China is ruining everything! ||| yes they do. I've heard they're starting to build giant filters now, for their air pollution problem... crazy. ||| problem is that's a localized issue.  they need to correct their massive global warming pollution problem. ||| Them and India.  I don't blame India too much though.  There's just a billion of them, and they're all just now being able to afford a/c, so of course they'll need the energy for all that progress. ||| Yeah, from what I've seen of their cities, they aren't in good shape.  Especially their rivers. ||| bye ||| I can't believe that we're still fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan... ||| I'm sure when Bush said that we were gonna go get those evildoers back in 2001, there weren't a lot of peole that thought we'd still be at it twenty years later. ||| This is true.War is big business. ||| When you listen to the guys with the boots on the ground though, they tell a different story about how they need to be there. ||| damn.  that sucks.  I hate hearing that kind of stuff. ||| Yeah they're definitely lost in the middle of all this conflict.  And it's hard to blame some of them for developing a resentment of us and the western world. ||| And you know they know we're using them for their oil. ||| i know it would solve so mny of the worlds problems if we could get away from oil. ||| It is pretty remarkable the lengths humans will go to to attain/preserve their power. ||| Yeah it's almost an addiction.  An addiction that makes them lose touch of their humanity. ||| bye ||| Me as well.  I feel bad for these people, but I don't necessarily blame the governments.  There is a massive influx of refugees globally, and no existing programs can handle them all. ||| Yeah.  I get that they're not in great conditions, and that sucks, but it's asking a lot to suddenly create good living conditions for so many people. ||| Yeah, and I know people don't like to hear this, but it really is compounded by the fact that many of these refugees come from areas that harbor terrorists. ||| I was wondering that.  I didn't really know where Calais was, so I didn't know where these people were from. ||| Ah.  Yeah, people don't like it, but you do have to be shrewd when allowing people in from an ISIS controlled area. ||| Sure, otherwise they'd just go back right?  At least this place gives them some sort of hope? ||| Maybe that's terrible of us to think, but I feel like it's the truth. ||| Again, I hate to say it, but what is with this region of the world?  I'm sure I sound like a bad person, but I just feel like the religion of Islam lends itself to some pretty crappy conditions. ||| I was at the zoo with my son the other day in florida, and the heat index was almost 110.  There was a muslim couple there and the woman was completely clothed in her hijab, and I just felt bad for her.  What kind of religion forces people to swelter in the hot dessert sun? ||| you too! bye. ||| That's really unfortunate about the situation in Kenya, it's crazy how it feels like everywhere you turn, there's another humanitarian crisis going on. ||| It sounds like there just aren't enough people willing.  The UN sends their peacekeepers, but they're still dependent on soldiers, and no countries are willing to send theirs. ||| Lol everything that's wrong with the world today could probably be attributed to the Western civ in one way or another.  That's probably the point though, the Western people are selfish. ||| Yeah.  Hopefully with time, these nations will become stable.  It seems like there are many that are. ||| Right.  It's incredibly hard to band together in situations like this, there's so many different people vying for power. ||| Yeah.  That's what kind of confused me about the article.  I couldn't tell which side, if any, the UN supported.  Seemed like the rebels may have been the good guys, as it mentioned the government was raping people... ||| Yikes.  I really respect people like that who are willing to go and help.  Takes a lot of guts and courage. ||| Yeah it's much harder, but much more effective to give your time towards a cause, as opposed to your dollars. ||| Aren't they heavy into trying to solve Malaria or something? ||| That's cool.  I'm not trying to sound like a bitter betty, but I wonder what portion of his fortune he's giving, in relation to a normal person's income? ||| Wow.  Not related, but I read some thing about how Bezos's fortune, before the divorce, if made into one dollar bills could go to the moon and back like four times, then get stacked nine km high or something like that. ||| I'm good to go, great talking to you fellow poor person! bye. ||| I think it's really unfortunate, and I don't blame people in the middle east for hating the West. ||| lol ok.  Still sucks to have to move your dead kids on a blanket because some other country bombed you. ||| only the terrorists and taliban are terrorists.  not all the civilians caught in the backlash. ||| don't you wish that wasn't the case though? ||| i see how this is going... well why don't we just do more testing instead of bombing actual people ||| yeah that's true this is just a crusade to further our western ways. ||| Yeah we're the big dogs fuck everyone else! ||| well, I hope we don't make everyone else in the world hate us, and cause another 9/11 with your plan though.. ||| yolo amirite? ||| man you really are a different breed.  good luck to you out in the real world! ||| lol bye. ||| Yeah i remember reading about it in other countries, but I didn't know it was still in America.  Definitely didn't know squirrels carried it. ||| Thanks God for Jesus, taking care of his creation, humans, but fucking all the other ones he made... ||| Sorry, I should clarify, he's taking care of his chosen people. Western white civilization. ||| Lol only like 1% of em.  At least that's something they're choosing to do, and not involuntarily getting infected with squirrel leprosy though! ||| eh, I wouldn't let that kind of stuff bother you though, it's annoying, but it really doesn't affect you if you don't let it. ||| Sure doesn't sound like you don't care, you pivoted from leprosy squirrels to Jesus and cut off dicks reeeal quick ||| Lol good to know.  Anyway, thanks to the article, I now know to keep my distance from Armadillos. ||| What's the hunta virus? ||| Do you think they go to cookouts together, and their virus parents brag about what great virus's they've become? ||| hunta talks so much shit about ebola's ribs to their nephew malaria... ||| Mumps is always getting drunk and groping his cousins wives. ||| they seriously get around, i personally got fucked by the flu twice last year. ||| lol bye"
p064,"I had no idea that people that are trying to arrest poachers are being attacked by people that live in the town. It is also so sad that the police act like cowards and do not arrest the poachers who are making certain animals extinct from the planet for selfish reasons. It's so sad that people that are trying to do the right thing are risking losing their life. ||| Wow, I can not believe that this poor elephant has been abused for so many years yet nobody does anything about it. This poor elephant should be taken away from the owner and the owner should be arrested, there is no excuse for this type of behavior, she should be allowed to be free in a elephant sanctuary with other elephants, very sad.  ||| The article I just read was very sad, it is terrible how people that are in trouble in their countries cannot leave because of the country that they are from. It doesn't matter to Germany whether or not they will get killed if they get sent back and these people shouldn't be turned away by Germany.  ||| I just read an article about how Wind turbines are killing more than just local birds, they are killing golden eagles and other large birds as well that are in migration. They are attracted to the wind because it helps them soar so that is why they go near it. Its horrible that these beautiful creatures are getting killed by a made man creation.   ||| I just read an article about a dog that was shot in a park when it was off it's leash, it was running and jumping towards a man and he shot and killed it. It is very sad and I am not sure why the man acted in that way, he didn't need to shoot the dog, the dog didn't even bite him. I am shocked there were no charges against him ||| I am not sure how I have never heard of this happening before but it is so sad. So many innocent people and children are being killed for no reason, it reminds me so much of how the Nazi's treated the jews but it is happening now and nobody is stopping them. It's unbelievable and so sad, I do not understand how the world is letting this happen.  ||| It is shocking that these poor children are starving because the government cares more about spending money on the military for weapons than food for its people. No child should even know what hunger feels like, the only thing they should be focusing on is playing with their friends and school. What a shame for these poor kids.  ||| How unfortunate that the sea creatures that were already endangered in this area got harmed because of the diesel spill, it is great that it was cleaned up so quickly but it looks like the damaged is already done from the bad weather. Hopefully the company that was responsible for this got fined, these spills need to stop happening.  ||| It is pretty alarming that an accident like this could happen, to me it seems like an accident but you never know. It's so sad that three soldiers lost their life due to a miscommunication, US is doing a favor to them by helping and they do not seem to fully appreciate that, they need to be more careful with their allies.  ||| I think that it is shocking that people waste so much food yet think that everybody is wasting more food than them. I go to the grocery store and see how much stuff people have in their carts and how much money they spend so it's no shock to me that people waste so much food, there is no way they can eat it all. Maybe they are not aware that they are wasting so much food and how bad it is for the environment. ","I do too ||| Yes that would be ideal, their local authorities should be invovled ||| Yes, they are very unsympathetic in the fact that that person had to leave everything behind to try to get into Germany just to be turned away, I couldn't imagine being in a situation like that ||| It makes me very grateful as well, I wish that people didn't have to live that way ||| Also, I am sure they probably accept some people that are trying to get into Germany for the wrong reasons, like the economy but don't accept people that are in trouble with the cartel ||| Exactly, just people some people are from certain countries doesn't mean they are bad people ||| Yea this whole thing reminded me of the USA as well, Its disgusting how they treat these children ||| So inhumane and sad ||| Yes I think so too, its very strange to me when people support the unfair treatment of immigrants ||| Yes it is, every aspect is ||| No ||| bye ||| Yes, I had no idea that this was even an issue ||| Exactly and it seems like, hopefully, we will head in to that direction to slow down global warming.. i guess you can never win no matter what you do ||| Because I believe coal fired energy kills birds as well ||| I wonder if they could make something that stops them from coming near the windmills ||| Yes, there needs to be a way to do something since coal fired energy is probably worse ||| Really? I didn't know there was a good side ||| That's very interesting ||| Couldn't solar panels produce the same amount of energy ||| What do you think is the best kind of power? I read an article that wind turbines cause cancer ||| That is true ||| Yes i have, they are beautiful. I saw one at a park in NJ. Have you? ||| Yea haha. I have seen a few large birds pick up baby squirrels by my house to eat them. Freaked me out ||| Maybe they can make smaller wind turbines so they don't kill birds ||| They are attracted to the wind it creates because it helps them glide better... its like putting sugar out on your counter and not expecting to get ants ||| No, do you? ||| bye ||| Yeah, I do agree that it is annoying when people don't follow the rules and just let their unleashed and very bad dogs in a park. I have left parks before because I have 2 small children and do not want unleashed dogs around them ||| Yes, I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old, its enough having to watch them around water since we live by the beach. People just let their dogs go unleashed all the time and then they run towards my children and you don't know if these dogs are up to date on their vaccinations either ||| I looked up the article and it was a very big black lab. Also the dog was dancing around the man, so it was going to attack him ||| I have a German Shepard, she is so sweet and is scared of her own shadow but she is never allowed to be alone with the kids. My in laws have 3 (very bad) dogs and they scare me and they are a forth of the size as my dog ||| Yea that is terrifying. Police dogs are known to attack children too, just because they are trained to kill basically ||| Yep, as soon as my in laws got their last dog they don't even baby sit anymore and just go googly eyes over a silly dog, kind of weird. They should want to see the grand babies ||| It is! I would think when I have grand children I would want to see them as much as possible. I was reading up and dog people are freaking out that the guy didn't get charges pressed against him. Face palm ||| Well when i first read it i thought the dog was just playing around and the guy was just shooting the dog because he had a few screws loose but then i looked up the article somewhere else ||| Yea I am kind of in the middle, I know some people are violent against dogs for no reason and that is not acceptable but the dog was definitively going to attack that man. ||| Thank you, you too! ||| goodbye ||| I know, I couldn't imagine being in that situation, its like a genocide there ||| Me neither, its crazy that the world is letting this happen in this day ||| Yes i guess history is meant to repeat itself I just couldn't imagine being put in their shoes ||| Yea, I am not sure if ISIS has been defeated yet, I feel like I do not hear much about them anymore ||| Yea and that article was from 2016 so I do not know how it resolved but I am sure their community is damaged beyond repair ||| Seriously, so incredibly strong, so much strength ||| Exactly, its all first world problems compared to this. This is pure evil ||| I don't know, I have had kids from my high school die in the war so its hard for me to say ||| The rest of the world doesn't want to help thats the problem ||| If they helped it would be a different story, but they don't and they just watch... same with the immigrant issue. Nobody does anything but the US ||| I think they slowed down with taking them in and then they get forced to go back ||| No, not really ||| bye ||| Seriously, its so sad that these poor kids are denied food.\\ ||| Exactly, I know about 30% of the kids in my son's school are provided lunch and breakfast for almost free by the government and its not the fault of the parents its just how it goes sometimes ||| Yea its sad the government doesn't recognize that the children are the future and they should be provided food so that they go to school ||| Yea the parents probably have trouble working since they are starving as well, and that probably makes it even harder to provide for their family ||| Exactly, I think its basically impossible for people to reach out to people like this because the government is so untrustworthy ||| I am sure very rich people have looked into helping but I don't think anybody can help them ||| Me neither, I have 2 kids and they get everything they want/need... I couldn't imagine it any other way ||| Exactly, I think that all the time and its about dumb stuff like shoes and pokemon cards. It makes me really appreciate what we have in this country ||| I've been doing these Empathic Conversation HITS for the last 2 or 3 weeks and its so sad how people in other countries are living and I do not think many americans are aware of it ||| Yea the only think I see on the news is about politics and its so annoying, nobody is aware of the world we live in and apparently neither am I because I didn't know about these issues until I started doing these HITS ||| I do too, its very interesting ||| Same! bye ||| I am so shocked that people that are getting the poachers arrested are getting attacked by the people in the town, you would think they would be happy to have these criminals arrested but I guess they support them ||| Yea or maybe their family is the poacher ||| Exactly, the police part is shocking too, how they just fled.. what is the point in having police if they are cowards ||| Yes, I guess they are afraid too of the organized crime ||| Yea, when we have no Rhino on the planet we just have ourselves to blame ||| Because this has been going on forever, I understand when some of the animals have to be killed and somebody places a bid to kill the animal but the poaching is just ridiculous ||| Yea, I wish there was something else to do for these community's so that they do not have to poach to survive but they would probably not stop anyway... i believe they get a lot of money for killing the rhinos ||| Yea, the USA is always the world police but I agree america should step in for this ||| I guess it depends on their role in the operation, if they are on the bottom, a few years in prison but if they are the leader of the operation i think life ||| yea some people probably do it because they need to feed their children while other people are living a lavish lifestyle ||| Really? Thats disgusting ||| Oh wow, like that doctor that killed the lion ||| I am not sure what happened with that but he was just a disgusting individual ||| All of these emphatic conversation HITS are really opening my eyes to all of these international world problems that I have otherwise never really thought about ||| For real! It makes me really love our country ||| Nope, I love where I live. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else ||| bye ||| Hello, This article is so sad. I can not believe they allow this animal to be stuck in a cage all day ||| Yes, but most of those people did something to deserve that. ||| Well I am thinking of the united states, not other countries. I have been to safaris where they rescue animals and they integrate fine and have much more room to roam than a small cave ||| Yea for sure ||| Have you been to the one in disney world or six flags ||| This one Nosey, got sent to a elephant sanctuary in Tennessee. In DIsney & Six Flags they are in a massive area and sectioned off by what region of the world they live in, put with animals that wont kill each other, the elepants have their own area which is huge with lots of other elephants ||| People can probably visit the sanctuary as well, I visit an animal sanctuary with my kids sometimes. I have a dog ||| I've never really thought about animal rights, how about you ||| What is Factory Farming? ||| Oh gotcha, yea I don't think people know much about that and those issues are rarely even talked about in the news. People just buy whatever is at the store ||| bye ||| Exactly what I was thinking, there is already so much trash in the ocean and this just adds to it ||| Are you kidding me? That's so disturbing, I lived in Fort Lauderdale at the time of the oil spill and I just remember seeing it floating at the top of the water and nobody was doing anything about it ||| Yea exactly, there's no regulations to stop this stuff from happening. The owner of the tug boat in the article apologized and that was it ||| For the oil spill that happened 10 years ago i think they might require that whoever has the pipe in the water create a 2nd one so that the oil spill can be fixed in 3 days instead of 3 months.... but for the tug boat incident IDK what could be prevented other than using a different fuel than diesel ||| yea its crazy that these fail safes aren't in place already, I mean that oil spill didn't even put BP out of business ||| Yes that would be nice, I worry about what the world will be like for my childrens, children if we don't become more green and start taking better care of the planet ||| Yeah, which is a good thing, its necessary at this point ||| Yea and I don't think we can prevent some areas from going underwater at this point ||| Yea its wild, people are raising their houses in my area and the water its a few inches from the top of their dock, its silly ||| bye ||| Yea that is what it seems like, not exactly sure how that happened but its sad that it had to escalate to that ||| Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \\ ||| Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train them ||| Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prison ||| The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselves ||| Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates. I have 2 sons and would never let them join the army, so much mental illness in the military unfortunately. ||| Really? I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the military ||| What's the difference? ||| Oh gotcha, I've known 2 people from the air force that did well afterwards and 1 guy from the marines that had a really hard go afterwards... but def different personality types ||| Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to have ||| haha bye ||| Hello, I do not find it shocking, when I go grocery shopping I find it kind of insane with how much food people have in their carts like no way they can eat it all ||| I am pretty good with sticking to my recipes and my list but I have a problem with produce since it seems to go bad a lot of the time before we have time to eat it ||| I try to cut off the bad pieces but sometimes its not salvageable ||| Thats a good idea, my neighbor has a little compost that she uses for a garden which is cool. What type of food do you waste the most of ||| Yea I have a problem with wasting pasta, i guess people need to be more conscious of when they think they are making too much of something ||| I try to switch it up but I make steak, fish, quesadillas, chili, grilled chicken and then have to make a separate meal for my picky eaters ||| Which thing? What do you usually cook ||| For real? Learning how to cook is a very valuable tool, how old are you? ||| I am 30, my boyfriend in college was a chef though so maybe i got a head start in the culinary world ||| bye"
p065,"Hey, I just read this article that I want to tell you about. Apparently, seabirds are eating plastic because plastic emits a scent that it similar to food. Plastic in the ocean gets coated with algae which emits a sulfur smell that some seabirds love. Pretty crazy, right? Anyway, it's sad what we're doing to our environment. It's sadder that we are pretty powerless to do anything about it. It's only a matter of time before everything justs collapses on itself. But at least we'll have iphones so we can video record the Apocalypse. ||| Hey buddy, I just read about yet another officer involved shooting of an African American. Although this incident is pretty old news, it told of the unrest in Charlotte after a black man was killed by the police. In the protests, someone (not a cop) fired into the crowd, wounding a civilian and four police officers. It's just a sad commentary on where we're at with race relations in this country. Even sadder: I don't see it getting any better any time soon... ||| Hye buddy, I just read an article that you might find interesting. Apparently, wind turbines that companies use for power generation kill a lot of birds every year. But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless. It seems that no matter how much we try to protect the environment, our effect on it is always worse than we imagine. ||| Hey man, Apparently, Indonesia is going through a crisis between conservation and alleviating its poverty. The country has made regulations protecting peat areas and the habitat of orangutans, but it has also given licenses to a company that aims to destroy a significant portions of those areas. I fell that this is a troubling sign and, sadly, indicative of the kinds of compromises that governments make with corporations that continue to endanger at risk species.","Hello, pretty interesting article... ||| Yeah, I thought that smell would have somehting to do with it, but it's crazy that they are now attracted to plastic waste in the oceans. ||| Well, yes and no. It will be too late for a lot of species, but we'll save ourselves. ||| Yeah. And protections for endangered species are being stripped away. Now, I'm not a hardcore environmentalist, I mean, I recycle and all that, but it's pretty hard to ignore the damage being done. ||| Well, some are very religious and believe that the earth was made to be used up by humans leading up to judgement day. ||| True. Some developing and even first world countries see it as their right to grow industry, as we have over the last two centuries, and that they should be able to do what they deemed necessary to grow, just as we have. ||| Sure, but we have a priviledged position to dictate taht. We can enjoy the advantages of doing stuff the wrong (yet wildly profitable) way, so that we can enjoy that advatage and then set new, more stringent rules for everyone else. I'm not saying they are right in thinking that, but it's hard to argue... ||| Yup. It's tough all around. Plus, if we could just end our love affair with red meat, then we could effectively halt global warming - but, I still want the freedom to have a steak when I want one, lol ||| Yeah. I don't eat red meat as much as I used to, but I still do enjoy the taste of a burger and steak. You know, 100 years from now, the world will probably be on a veggie and insect diet, but I want to hold off on eating grasshopper burgers for the time being. ||| Yeah, lol. It's not that far off. It will probably be insects instead of rats, but, yeah, bascially what we consider vermin and pests will be our main food sources. ||| yeah. Someday, it will be a thing here, only it will be a hipster eco-trend, like composting and urban gardens. ||| Oh, that's gonna happen in a big way. Electric is gonna take over, at least in the cities. Self-driving cars will be the norm in cities too. ||| Ha, I hear ya - the thought is unsettling, but no more unsettling than all those bad human drivers out there... ||| Likewise! I think I have to say it first, then you. so, goodbye ||| This article is a bit old, referencing the 2016 campaign, but it is still poignant and relevant today. ||| I don't think they can directly. They are symptoms of a larger problem. ||| Yes, even though that was co-opted to become about being anti-patriotic... ||| True. Now, I believe that there are way more good police than bad, but it's obvious that some people are attracted to police work because it gives them a gun and the license to use it in public without fear of retribution ||| Yes. Really, again, these are just symptoms though. Most of these social conflicts are really just proxies for the real problem, which is wealth disparity, which leads to scapegoating ||| Yeah, or rather they only care so far as it keeps them entrenched in the 1% ||| Well, it's tough, because competition and profit fuels development, but it's a fact that wages have been stagnate (or even dropped against the value of the dollar) since the mid-90s ||| Ha, oh, that number is very real... ||| Yeah, all you need to know about what Bezos thinks of people is look at mturk: we're all busting our butts in bubble hell to sniff minimum wage - but, at least I can do it in my robe... ||| That's an interesting question. Probably. I often say that if you want to know what humanity is about, just look around at what we do. We are what we do. But, a lot of it is due to developing in a climate of scarcity, where there is the perception that there are not enough to go around (which really should not be true anymore). ||| Yes. It's tough. But, what is going to happen in 20 years when automation, robotics, and AI eliminates A LOT of jobs. WE're already nearing a tipping point. What happens when there are simply not enough jobs for people anymore? ||| Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Basically, a form of socialism, but it's hard to get there without a real economic collapse. As long as it functions somewhat, then we're stuck with the current economic model, which means more racial scapegoating and more violence. ||| Yeah, and that's the problem. We're just content with what we're given. ||| Yeah, our values are just out of whack. But, again, it is who we are. We want to point a finger at some 'other', some boogeyman, because it's easier and safer than point a finger at a crooked system, because that seems like too big of a problem to solve. ||| True, but it's not just the government, it's everything, all of it. The whole structure and processes of society. It's a massive problem that will only be solved if we reach some crisis that necessitates huge change. ||| Yes, something at that level. People won't change unless their comfort is threatened. It doesn't have to be existential, but big enough to rattle everyone. ||| Well, I think there are way too many laws governing personal behavior. Most things that do not directly harm others should be legal. Abortion. Suicide. Gambling. Prostitution. Some drugs. Legalize, regulate and tax. The problem isn't the act themselves, it's the criminality, which breeds abuse and exploitation, because where can you turn if you know that what you're doing could get you locked up? ||| Yes, that's right. Our society shouldn't punish people for making what others would deem to be a mistake. It should be more forgiving and permissive. Drug addition should not be a criminal matter - it should be viewed as a public health matter. ||| Probably, but I also think that there should be way more police. And, yeah, the role of police should shift away from 'catching bad guys' to supporting communities. ||| Yes, exactly - I also think that police should live in the precincts they work in. ||| Well, ti was really cool chatting with you. I don't know if we solved any of society's problems, but it was fun. goodbye"
p066,I read an article about old people in Aleppo where they ended up being neglected in the conflict. Their children and grandchildren often flee to safer countries but the elderly aren't usually afforded the same luxury. One old man lamented that he had spent his whole life to create a better place for his children and grandchildren and all that work was now null and void. What a tragedy.,"I thought it was tragic ||| I cant imagine working your whole life for you kids and grandchildren just to watch it go up in flames like that ||| What hit you the most from the article ||| yeah it would be miserable to have to ration food like that ||| I worked in an old folks home for a while and its sad even there, I cant imagine many of those people trying to make it on their own again in those circumstances ||| I understand fleeing to another country with your family, but I can't imagine having to leave behind a parent/grandparent like that ||| Not just the elderly either, people with disabilities would probably be left behind as well ||| Do you know if that war is still going on? I haven't kept up with current events as much as I should. ||| it does seem that way. I wonder if the elderly would want to leave too if given the option, or if they felt like they should stay because its what they have known ||| Well I hope that my family never has to see anything like that or make those decisions - off topic but do you want to try to go for 15 or 20 turns for the bonus? ||| actually I need to go, thanks for the conversation, bye ||| goodbye"
p067,"That's awful, I feel that Oklahoma City might not be as safe as I thought. After 9/11 they raised security around airplanes a lot, but it hasn't been perfect. They probably can never get it perfect. I guess it wasn't terrorism exactly though? Just a regular murder. That's just awful either way. There should definitely be a thorough investigation. ||| This is sad. Dogs don't deserve that. Police that leave dogs in cars should be ashamed. I don't really believe they suffered consequences for it, police never do. I think that there should be more precautions to make sure dogs are not left alone in cars, especially when the one responsible is supposed to have training to deal with that sort of thing. ||| That's terrible that the dog was left to die. Maybe there should be consequences for it. You should know that I feel good about dogs and don't want them to die. It is upsetting especially given their important role and how much training is required for them, and how much responsibility their handlers are supposed to have. ||| Wow, I had no idea squirrels had leprosy. That's crazy. And it's the same type that afflicts humans? I didn't think it was a very big problem or something worth paying attention to though. I wonder if this article is really true. It probably is. Leprosy is a pretty sad disease since it makes people nto feel pain and injure themselves.","Yes, dogs shouldn't be left in cars like that, there should be more responsibility taken here. ||| That kind of makes sense, I was not sure whether to believe they suffered consequences at all honestly ||| yeah, I wonder how realistic that even is though, the consequences always seem vague and small ||| would they really be charged with that? That definitely seems hypocritical ||| That makes sense, but the difficulty would be convincing the local prosecutor to take on the case, and the rest of the police force to be willing to provide evidence ||| hm, I'm not sure. In any case there should also be procedures for making sure that doesn't happen in the first place ||| that's a lot of years, but perhaps he deserves it. ||| I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk ||| no, I think you're being very reasonable. Yeah maybe they would be more careful. They definitely should be. ||| ideally it would be possible. The goal should be preventing things like this from happening to begin with however that can be done most effectively ||| That makes sense. Maybe there could be specific training too? I'm not sure what the best procedure is for making sure dogs are safe in cars in all situations ||| makes sense. Alright, nice talking to you, goodbye ||| hi I thought it was kind of sad that the dog died ||| how could they have prevented it ||| yeah that makes sense, perhaps also better oversight ||| well I mean, that there is more accountability for the wellbeing of the dog. Like some impartial person who checks ||| yeah its really sad, the poor dog, had nothing to do with it ||| I don't know if they were right to characterize it as an accident, doesn't seem like the right word ||| I'm pretty sure it takes a lot of time and effort to train drug dogs ||| \paid administrative leave\"" see that phrase too much"" ||| oh, I didn't mean it was on purpose, just that, accidents are different from negligence ||| yeah not a lot of info to go on ||| bye ||| I have a lot more questions than answers after reading that, like how did they even know for sure they had the right suspect ||| not a lot of info, maybe they were trying to avoid public panic, or just didn't know much ||| you would think airports would be more locked down ||| I suppose, it did say he was in a parking garage, you don't have to go through security even for that ||| if it was a terrorist, I think they could probably do more damage without even getting on a plane ||| probably normal reasons for murder, personal grievances etc ||| yeah it doesn't add up, I really wonder why they believed the man in question was the real suspect, or if that was just the convenient assumption ||| frustrating that there are not really reliable sources of info ||| if even, not like they've released much on JFK etc ||| maybe by then they will have figured out how to get airport security right ||| yeah it's all security theater, not sure if actual security would even be possible tbh ||| what does Israel do ||| I think I read something about how they do a lot of face and body language reading, but also probably racial profiling ||| hmm ||| I am not sure, in this particular case at least I don't know if it would have made a difference ||| yeah a very tragic situation ||| yes, not sure how people can think that's a good idea. Well that's all I have to say, bye ||| hello, I thought it was very interesting ||| a little, but I never hear about people having leprosy ||| yeah that is pretty scary. I don't think there is a cure? ||| Even if you don't, if you had a cat or something I wonder if it could be a transmission vector ||| haha sorry ||| nope, lots of squirrels around here though ||| I'm not sure, did the article mention confirmed cases of transmission? ||| well, it's because they aren't able to notice when their body parts bump into stuff right ||| not just that but it would also make people freaked out to be near you, since the condition is so transmissible ||| ok, bye"
p068,"Any tyoe of animal poaching and killing just really hurts my heart. It is disgusting that this kind of thing is still happening and that not everyone can agree to fiercly protect these gentle giants. I get that these countries are poor and this kind of hunting and trading brongs in big money for them but I think they need to look at the bigger picture and more countries should help build these countries up in others ways so they dont have to rely on this for there people and economy. I also agree with the conservationist that say all the paper laws in the world cant cut down on the killings if you dont control illigal trade that is were the focus needs to stay on. ||| This poor child I just feel so bad. You would think someone would check the windows and make sure there secure with children is an apartment building off the ground. If it was me I would have some sort of safety lock on them because I know children can do anything. Maybe the parents were just not educated on the dangers but it seems irresponsible they didnt check or know that was happening. That poor child died such a painful death it is hard to even fathem. Thankful for the guard who called 911 so someone didnt find the body later on. Im sure the parents feel horrible and blame themselves that is very sad to me.  ||| I feel so bad that this effected so many creatures and the enviroment on such a grand scale. From the food, to the drinking water, to the economy. This river was a main source of life for everyone and it has been ruined forever. I feel for the guy who said it feels like he lost a family memeber a life lost because its been a source of life for so many for so long. It is very unfair that the clean up is so slow going and that they are taking so long to fix there wrong. I also feel bad for the fish who died because mud was stuc in there gills its such a slow painful death. I would never drink or eat from that river again as who knows how that can effect people and if itll ever really be clean. ||| Reading about this insane war zone and killings was so graphic and made me so sad. I think so much more needs to be done to defeat ISIS they are like the black plague spreading in the middle east. They hate america and destroy innocent lives I just dont know how you could kill so many people and not feel bad. They are killing people and show casing them in the streets it is hard to understand how in this day and age groups can do that it reminds me of the nazis during the holocaust I fear if this is not taen care of soon it will spread to other areas liek the us with more terroristic events happening. ||| I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local. ||| How can your heart just not break reading this article. These children had there life cut way to short for no reason. This father was just pure evil. He needed serious mental help and I can't believe no one saw this coming. There is always signs that people should take serious so it doesnt come to this. I would like to know the motive was it because he felt overwhelmed or because he wanted to get back at someone. The mother should have taken the threat seriosuly and I wonder if the rangers had found the car sooner if those kids would have been alive. They were probably so afraid in that car and it is horrible that was there last memories alive. ||| I feel for both sides on this one. The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country. I can see being so desperate in a third world country that this would seem like the police are cutting off or taking your only source of livlihood. These poor guys however they are just trying to protect and do what is right they do not deserve to be so violently attacked im suprised they were able to live through such a brutal beating. I hope more is done to help the police but also the village  ||| This article was just heartbreaking. I just pictured my father working his whole life for us just for a warm and horrible people to come in and tear it down. It is pure hell for everyone living in this war torn area I cant imagine. No older people who worked there life so there familys can be better should be worried about war and losing the family. The doctors have even fled as there is no resources to help people anymore. Only once dialysis center left which will probably close soon for fear of people and lack of resources. Anyone with a chronic disease is just out of luck as medicine is few and aid cant even be reached to most of these people anymore. It is just so sad. ||| An article like this really tears me in half. I can put myself in both of there shopes and see both sides. I feel like because this officers job is to protect and serve the community he shows he has good character and morals and this was not done out of malice. but also this dog provided a service to the community and did not deserve to dye such a long painful death.I think if anything does comes out of it it should be more safety and precautions put in place so these things can not happen again. This handler must feel horrible as i know the dogs become like there actual partners and family. I think the guilt is punishment enough. ||| This story was so sad and heartwrenching. I guess the elite are not pardoned from bad things happening to them and this shows that. It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces. I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison. How could you kill and burn someone and for over something so minecule like getting hit on. Karma will get back at them and I hope in a grand way. The poor family of this man it is terrible. ||| This article just hits you right in the gut. Especially because it deals with animals. Animals are so helpless when at the hand of there human handlers. This is so unfair to this gentle giant. Treated to badly just to perform and make money. she is livign a horrible confined life of solitude. It is greatly disturbing that the givernment has the power to stop this yet has turned a blind eye. They need to take action and be an advocate for this poor animal. She deserves way better treatment then what she is getting now. How does anyone condone this or go to shows where this animal is chaned and obviously in pain and discomfort.  ||| This article really made me tear up. It is so sad a family could just be taken in a split second like this. I cant imagine the whole left behind in the remaining surviviors life. This town needs some better traffic laws and maybe drivers licensure tests. It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt. I hope everyone gets therapy to talk about how much this probably effected them. ||| This article was a little hard for me to follow with the different people and places. I think south africa needs a great peace keeping leader to step in and take the rains. It breaks my heart these people are subject to being afraid of such violence and brutality. The women that were raped and especially by there government is nonesense and cant believe in 2019 this is still happening. They need to create a more civilized society over there. Even aid workers who are just there to help were brutally raped that tells me these people have no consequences for actions and to consious of human suffering. This whole article was truly apolling to me. ||| This article was a little hard to follow as I dont follow or know much about whats going on in the other side of the world. It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance. Something needs to be done to help. ||| This article is something i can really agree with. I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it. ||| I completely agree with this article. I think smoking around children is so dangerous and hazerdous! Zoos are such a child centered place its a  no brainer its like banning smoking at a play place or daycare. Children who see adults smoking will grow up thinking that is normal and part of life and I think smoking should seem like an odd thing like drugs. Kids are so suseptible to disease as they are growing and second hand smoke that young can do nothing but bad. These laws are really great and should be applied to any public place make smoking wierd like drinking alcohol in public because it not only effects you but everyone around you! ||| This is just crazy that people are still dying today when there is medicine that can easily save there lives. There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant. ||| This article was troubling on so many different levels. I cant put myself in this girls shoes because I would never imagine my parents doing this to me. I cant believe they are out of jail they seem like such a threat to society if they can do this to there own child. I pray these people never come in contact with a never child again. you are suppose to protect your kids. This girl can never get her childhood back i dont see how you could trust people after this or live a normal life my mind would be so messed up. i hope she gets the help she needs. ||| It is so crazy what a freak accident this was. These people couldnt even try to escape as it just happened. I think that way more safety and procedures being done for these people then just collecting fuel from a truck on the side of the rode. Anything can happen with such a flammable liquid and people that dont really know alot getting it out. I feel horrible for the people who responded to the scene as that had to have been so scarring to see. So many families will be at a loss from this and i think the government should do alot to help out with there life now. ||| I cant even imagine dying this way. It is such a slow and painful death being trapped somewhere scared with gas leaking. It is sad that this was totally preventable but somehow they overlooked safety. I think all mines should be shut down until full safety inspections can be done. They need to be able to justify working conditions and not just have people working to make money. All of these people had families that are just stuck without them for such a silly reason to die. The government needs to be held responsible for this. ||| Guys like this make me sick and so angry. The fact that he tried to say nothing every happened it was consentual and basically blaming the victims is beyond me. He tried to say he was already convicted because the news storys but it was his own behavior. You can't go around doing what you please to other people and hurting them for your own pleasure. I am so glad someone had the courage to speak up and stop this guy from hurting more women. In most cases you cant always be sure if the women is telling the truth or just getting back at a guy but multiple women coming forward you just have to believe this guy is a danger to society. He should be locked up for a very long time in my eyes. ||| Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed. ||| these poor animals that have to live in this oil spill. It is so unfair that many marine and bird species die at the hands of oil accidents and carelessness. There needs to be more policies in place to prevent these things from happening and more resources and procedures to make sure they are cleaned up fast and efficiently. it is sad that these animals probably died from lacking the ability to move or breathe but also there food sources taken away from them. It is scary that endangered species are also being effected as once there gone there never coming back and an oil spill is such a silly way for that to even happen. ||| this is so horribloe because anything that effects animals hurts me to the core. They are innocent victims and cant really help themselves in this situation. I think alot needs to be done to make sure the river is restored and blockage is taken away so that this does not happen in the future. These fish cant move debris themsleves and i thin more light needs to shine down on what is happening so maybe a council can come together and monitor or take over and make sure the fish are in a thriving enviroment. I thin if an enviromental emergency is declared and especially in a poor country other countries should step in and lend a helping hand to lesson the suffering to innocent life. ||| I cant believe someone could actually do this to another being. Kittens are so cute and friendly it would be like torchering a baby. Anyone with that kind of mindset on the lose is a danger to society. Mosy serial killers start out hurting innocent animals so this should be taken very seriosuly. Some kind of task force needs to be on this to make this person pay for what they did. Noone deserves to die such a sad and painful death. I cant believe how traumitized the people that found the kitten must be. Just reading this story made me almost cry I cant imagine seeing it.  ||| This article has me very torn. I will always be a supporter of police who protect us and put themselves in harms way everyday and I now they deal with a lot of difficult people and situations. It is up to police to use discretion with force they inlflict on others and I think I would need to see the whole video and backstory and there side to decide. I now serving warrants is one of the scariest things for officers to do as alot are shot at and they go wrong. Im sure with her resisiting and the growing crowd around them they need to control the situation fast. Closed fist punching seems very scary and severe but who knows what led up to that happening. I feel sorry for both parties involved. ||| This article is just horrifying. I understand that the police officers deal with hard to arrest people but punching someone yet alone a woman and mother is just horrible. I think less violent and severe tactics should have been taken in this case. It is there discretion but I think he was just taking his anger out on this lady and in no way should that be allowed. In front of her children and family. Maybe she was just worried the arrest was not suppose to happen, you should not be able to become violent out of anger. ||| I feel so sorry for the passengers and victims onboard. This would be my worst fear being on a train or plain having no control or way out of such a big accident. They must have been so afraid once the train started rocking back and forth. I wonder what actually caused this horrible accident in the first place. They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected. It seems to be a totally avoidable way to lose a life and needs to have more security measures put into place. ||| This article sais alot about the state of the country. I think many hispanic people are just angered and don't know where to tell there frustration. This man was probably trying to make some type of statement. With trump putting so much attention on this border and getting illigals out im sure he is scared and doesnt know what to do. This is a horrible way to go about it but I can see both sides. This poor older man who was shot for no reason. People need to think before they act, and more mental health help should be available to people feeling violent or angry.  ||| This article really concerns and scares me. This could be any one of us effected by high levels of lead and never knowing. I am suprised that there is a level expectancy but no prosecution for exceeding it and not regular testing of water. The general population does not now about there water unless it becomes a national crisis like flint. I am very cocerned because they said so many communities are effected what is this doing to the children who are growing up on this water. I will be switching to bottled water because I just do not trust the water anymore to much covering up going on its so sad. ||| Reading this story just made me feel so sad. Reading about him you could tell he was just a great guy that everyone loved and did alot to give back. It is sad how easily life can be taken. You can also see the team cherished him as they even got a visa and brought over his mother for him. People will really miss him in the community and team and that is the best thing to leave behind a legacy. It is so odd that they went full speed into the rocks, I wonder if some kind of medical emergency happened as they said they did not suspect drugs or alchol. It is also sad that two other people lost there lives. Time is very precious on this earth ||| This article really maes you think about the foster care system in america. We are one of the richest and advanced nations but yet our foster care system is low and bad. Compared to europes who keep the parental rights kids are left to wonder here. Children like this situation who have no structure get put in foster care and seen as bad ids when in reality they just need more love affection and direction.There should be more care done for these children as there life is just bad from the time there put in care. I feel so sorry these brothers had to grow up like this but happy he turned his life around got an education and is now in a career to help others and foster care children. ||| This artile is so sad I cant believe the mass amounts of lives being taken that is so preventable. I think more aid should be sent and they should be able to sail ships in there territory to help aid these people. It is sad to think people think the chance of death is better than living where they are. The smugglers need to controlled so so many boats arent sent out and it over whlems rescue missions. I feel for the parents who send there children on this and the children end up dying i cant imagine. Someday i hope more aid is sent to help countries like this fix the problems at home so so many people dont want to flea ||| Cancer is so scary to me and knowing that air pollution something you cant really control can shorten your life even more is so scary. People die so frequently from this disease I wish there was more awareness and laws put in place to help reduce it. I think cigarettes should be outlawed instead of weed. It has been proven the harm they can do to people and kill them, its crazy that there still around to this day. I think more air pollution laws need to be put in place because people cant really help that alot and that clearly has an effect on human life. People should move to less air polluted states once they are diagnosed. ||| I feel for both sides on this story. Native americans have been kicked out of land and hold the land they do still have very precious to them. They are trying to protect what is theres and water for there people. They believe in the contract that was signed and want to keep the promise. On the other hand the police are just doing there job and trying to keep from any bad things happening. When you have people firing guns at police that is when things have to get more serious and they have to use force. You cant just block roads and set cars on fire. It was very sad that a horse was killed and that older people are getting hurt and arrested. ||| Frogs are not my most favorite animals but this article was truly sad. This disease seems to be very painful for them and killing and infecting them at alarming rates due alot to human interferance. I think that more awareness on what to do and what not to do when it comes to frogs and ponds needs to be out there on the news and told to people so they know maybe alot of it is just ignorance. Any living being should be protected if possible from dying a painful death and frogs are an important part of our ecosystem that we need to protect. Alot of time human interferance in nature will do this and cause some sort of issue. ||| I think it is disgusting men in such high power positions use it to just attack women like this. They think they can just get away with it and there actions have no consequences. So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me. Noone should deal with this alone and it should never be swept under the wrong or at blame of the women. ||| Articles like this really hit home for me. I think older people should really be protected and watched carefully as this happens alot. Alot suffer from dimentia and have no idea what is going on and can get lost very easily. It makes me think if this was my parent or grandparent I would be heartbroken. She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again. Mayb it is to much for the family now and she requires more assistance like a group home. ||| The whole refugee crisis is a big controversey these days. You think of the people that are doing this and put yourself in there shoes but also the countries who get these transplants and have to deal with them. Every human deserves a life free from harm and these lands really arent anyones but i can see having undocumented people invade your country is a bad thing that is why there is systems in place to keep track of people. I think more should be done to help these countries so people do not want to flee we need to build there government and police up so they are equipped to fight terrorist groups and rebels who push there citizens out. ||| I really feel for this country as a whole. It is like they are getting attacked from every side. It has got to feel so on edge living in syria. You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react. You have 24 hours to leave everything you know and love and probably never see it that way again it is crazy. ||| I will always feel so bad for children because they can not help themselves.Food is such a fundamental need in life that children cant be expected to excelif they are hungry during school. It is so sad that people need to keep children home just to line up to get food. They also cant afford to send them lunch and the government isnt stepping in to help which would be a good investment as they are the future of there society.Someone needs to step in send aid as teachers can only do so much they need to demand others to help out. Kids can not help themselves so they need others to step in and step up to help. ||| This crisis is so tender and near and dear. It is horrifying that such innocent souls are lacking basic nutrition and this is effecting every part of there life. Because they are so week form not eating they can't do much to fend for themselves especially because alot of them are orphaned children. It is horrifying that it is tough for aid to push through to these areas and the further they gain access to the more horrible the sights are. I can't imagine the children longing for there parents they are seperated from and longing for some sort of security in there lives. There food is gone there water is unsafe but it is nice to know that aid workers eventhough it is a tough site to see are remaining to truly help out. ||| This article really struck home for me. I am so sad that this wolf traveled 700 miles to find a new mate just to be killed sensesly. He traveled through rough conditions like a jill field and stillended up dying. I think thes eprograms by the government to kill animals is horrifying. We should all live together in hamony. If they are a pest we should find ways that dont harm them like relocating the animals to help the problem not kill innocent souls.Someday they will find a solution that wont harm lives and live in peace. ||| This whole article made my mood change so much. It is horrifying how people can do this to one another. They dont think about the other person as a lving being and that is so scary. These men should never be allowed out of prison for this brutal murder. They just tossed his body in a shallow grave and went on with there lives watching a payperview game. And the murder was just because he wasnt interested in one of them romantically that is insane! somehting is clearly not right in both of there minds for this to be okay. I feel for the man who lost his life in a horrible way for no reason at all. ||| This just has to hit you right in the heart. All the families and children out to have a fun night together and are killed and injured recklessly. I can't imagine that seen and so many people that were effected. The mother with her kids that were killed and her husband had just been killed earlier that summer in a car wreck. I am glad they will all be together in heaven atleast. That poor school having to deal with deaths of there classmates so young. I cant imagine that horrific seen for the emergency services when they arrive they were probably horrified and pray for them also. This is just such a senseless way to die. ||| This article really hits home for me as my father was a smoker. I am so grateful he choose to smoke outside and never around us kids. I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking. ||| This was just so sad and senseless. The brutal styel of killing and plotting behind this murde is crazy. Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened. Also the poor people stuck on the planes for three hours with a supposed shooter on the loose id be terrified. ||| This is one of those articles that just hits you in the guts. You put yourself in the victims shoes and think what would i have done could i have known. It is horrifying in this day and age someone could even make it around an airport with any kind of weapon. I would really like to learn the motive and connection the victim had with the suspect. Why do people kill others I will never understand. Also for the families that have to deal with the after math the kids who dont get a father anymore for no reason. That must have been so painful. Being stuck on an airplane while a murderer is running around the aiport would also send me in to panick. ||| You really cant help but put yourself in the victims shoes. Having dreams of becoming a doctor then one day your whole life changes and you cant do your dream anymore. It would be so scary to go blind not be able to see anything anymore you have to become dependent on on thers, you lose alot of your independence. I can understand that protests can become unsafe or even violent so you need tactics to over come that but with such numbers of people getting very hurt and permanently disabled I think thye should change there tactics. They should use more tear gas and change it to bean bag guns, a larger object that cant fit right into eyes . ||| An article like this just make you so glad to live in the united states. Where everything is regulated and we have laws. I can not imagine living in a place where the governemnt and law can do anything they please without consequences. Soldiers raping women burning down houses all with out real cause. Any aid workers and doctors are treated very poorly so theres not enough to go around how does this civilzation survive. Crazy how far behind and uncivilized some places still are in 2019. I think more light needs to be shown on this as real people are hurting. Everyone deserves to feel safe in there country. ||| This is such a disturbing article to read through. You just cant help but feel for the families of the victims so brutually killed. How could this coalition have such a lack of care for human life. The fact that they hit near a humanitarian run hospital is despicable. I am in aw that the us would in any way help when there is faulty information and so much civilian life loss. I feel for all these people that are now injured and have to go hours away for medical help because they had to shut this hospital down. ||| This article is so shocking and just stomach churning to me. How could your own flesh and blood do such horrible acts to you, a little girl. They stole her innocense and trust in people. They deserve life in jail the fact that they are out is just absurd. If they could do this to there own child i think they are to be considered at risk to other children and the community. It shows they have no moral compass and consious. I feel for that girl how you could ever live a normal life or create real relationships after being used for sex for so long is beyond me. I hope she has gotten appropriate therapy and other family to help her through. What a strong girl to go against her parents and stand up for herself. ||| This article just hits you when thinking about the victims and there last minutes. To be in a country set up like that after being involved in such a blast and being injured i would be mentally inconsolable and frightened as you cant rely on the medical emergency people and communication to save you I think that is why many tried running into the river. These poor people experienced un imaginable pain before dying. I think the site emergency repsonders who arrived at this seen with charred bodies everyhwere must have been traumautizing and to see humans suffering in such pain. I hope that there wernt more victims that ran into the woods and just died from extreme pain. I am horrified from this story. ||| I feel so sad that this freak fire has effected so many people. It has ruined the owners property which has got to be a big financial loss. It also has displaced so many people who have lived here. They have lost everyhting in the fire and i cant imagine having to rebuild or having the money to replace all my stuff and stuff thats irreplacable like pictures. I feel grateful that people were hurt and no one was killed it could have been way worse. Hopefully everyone had renters insurance to help pay for some of the damages. ||| I feel so bad for the victims and the victims families. They were just doing there job and this careless explosion cause them to lose there lives. It is sad that they know how deadly and unsafe these worker conditions are but still have yet to close them. I am happy they are set to close around 1,000 but i think more has to be done. There should be a council and regulations set up like osha in the us to protect workers and make sure all precautions are being done to preserve human life. Now families are left without there sons fathers and incomes when they could have easily just shut this down. I hope for safer woring conditions in the future. ||| The whole drug topic really makes me sad as I had a mother who I saw unravel from being addicted to pain killers. I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up. I have definitly seen way more about heroin overdose in my own suburbia it isnt disciminating agianst anyone it is sad it is ruining peoples lives. ||| This article was so disturbing to read through. I feel like theres so many different levels to these happenings and something has to be done on each to prevent little children from getting these pills in there hands. On the level of the manufactorers we need to have way better packaging like codes the kids cant get into. Doctors prescribing these should ask if they have kids and tell them preventetive measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. Parents need to have a better understanding how easy it is for kids to get into these and die. So senseless dying of something so easy to prevent. ||| This article really brings you back down to earth. It shows everything in science is not correct and there is still much for us to learn. It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns. ||| Articles like this really scare me. You have a disease that spreads with so much mystery behind it that it is hard to contain or stop it. So many poor little creatures are at risk for this and that makes me feel so sad. They die such a painful death or have a very bad quality of life. More should be done to aid these animals and get help, more protocal if you see an animal like this to help stop it from spreading the disease. ||| This is such a hard read. I cant imagine living in a war torn place where everyday you fear for your life. How sad these people died such a horrible hard death. The mother and sister have to live and rebuild there life without the kids and husband. How do you even go on after such a thing. There needs to be more aid and relief and stop all the bombing and violence. It is such a silly way to die over nothing.  ||| It is so sad the uprest that is happening in the middle east right now. I dont understand how cultures that rely on peace and light like india are involved in such violence. They need to have a meeting with leaders and figure things out diplomatically. I think war is just to tossed around over there when you have innocent victims and civilians being killed. They need to do things like trump be firm and have sanctions build walls but dont rely on iolence to get your way. The fact that the cease fire was broken and both sides have nuclear weapons scares me, that there is no line that they can not cross or break. ||| This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals. ||| I really feel for these soldiers on both side american and jordanian. It seems like it was a tough call because we are there allies and the us soldiers should have followed protocol by stopping.If it was a miscommunication I hope they take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again as fighting and killing eachother is a waste that needs to be for the bad guys. I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier. I wonder if it was a miscommunication or somehow the soldiers flipped into that bad guys. Either way I hope a full investigaton is done to try and prevent anything of this nature from happening in the future.  ||| I feel for anyone feeling targeted or unsafe under this president in office. I find that alot of worries are just fear mongering from liberal media. I think this happens with any president I know many whites were afraid of obama being in office and only serving african americans and same here they believe trump only will help out upper white class. But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating. Also, I think it is right that more of the illigal immigrants should be worried as he directly said he is going after them which is just since they are breaking out us laws.  ||| This article is very interesting to me. I think alot of consumers have a lack of education when it comes to food, food safety, labeling, and disposal. If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away. ||| I know it is odd but I always feel a sense of compassion for these shooters. Yes they are evil and need to be punished but thinking of what lead them to try and kill innocent people they must have had something horrible in there life happen or been in a very toxic enviroment. There should be more talks of mental health and treatment for people instead of banning guns. There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns. This was also odd because he was older 70 years old,and hispanic I wonder if the tension and state of the US made him angered and want to carry out this act. ||| This article just really hits you in the gut. How horrible is it that many families look perfect online but struggle in silence behidn closed doors. It seems the mom was going through alot of mental health issues and health issues with the baby that it took a tole on the relationship and maybe he was trying to hold onto something that was over with. She was married at such a young age i can see that being a reason to want something new we all grow. He seemed like if he couldnt have them he didnt want anyone else to. I feel so bad for the children who has nothing to do with this lost there lives so young. The police must have been traumatized by the scene they walked into. ||| Anything like what is in this article is so horrifying to me. How could a parent take the life of there child. How could a husband take the life of there wife. I can undertand people who commit sucide but to kill the whole family even the dog that is just evil. I think more help and mental reach out should be offered in communities to men. They bottle things up and this is what happens. Men are not allowed to show emotions and then they let it out in violence. I wish this woman had been able to escape sooner her and her children would still be around.  ||| This story is really horrifying to me. Knowing how bad lead is for people especially children this article is suprising. The fact that this seems so hush hish i scary. I am very glad I have been drinking bottled water for my family. I do not trust the government and this shows why. How could levels be so high and nothing be done and consumers not know. We are poisoning ourselves and familys and not even know. Something needs to be done to fix this issue! ||| Everything about Russia really freaks me out. I think this country really needs to be cut off until they can be a more peaceful society. It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world. He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown.

||| hey what did you think of the article ||| its so sad i feel for these innocent animals ||| me to and act more quickly after it happens ||| yeah you would think by now with so many oil spills there would be more done ||| agreed i think once it's to late they are going to be very sorry ||| yeah i remember about learning of that big one when i was in elementary school and all the animals it killed and that was so long ago i was suprised it effected the same capacity now ||| yeah i honestly cant remember either just how hard of an impact it had then that big one with i think shell ||| yeah swept under the rug its so sad ||| yeah there should be a central one would probably make it easier to fix ||| that is a great idea i wonder if you could write congress or something some advice ||| that would be a great idea no harm in trying!

||| on both sides me two ||| I agree what a silly way for them to die so preventable ||| i agree but it is complicated ||| true but it must be scary when bombers are randomly popping up ||| me two but it probably did so sad ||| wow thats so sad there just innocent victims ||| oh i think we need to each do ten turns before leaving, what are your thoughts about syria driving all this ||| I agree they need to come to peace to help promote a better life for there citizens and ones pf areas around them. ||| I agree bye! ||| hey what did you think about what we read ||| yeah i couldnt imagine having my train sway ||| exactly sounds like no safety measures or inspections are done ||| i agree something this is the second huge crash ||| same with little control of the outcome ||| no thank god we dont really have trains around here ||| wow haha thats just silly i guess it was like that but way faster ! ||| well that sounds like an easy fix lucky ||| yeah there pretty routine i wonder if they will investigate more ||| oh that is true need to stop the pattern of it happening ||| i can see that maybe the technology just needs to be updated ||| i have never heard of those thats interesting ||| that would seem scary to me high speed haha ||| wow that is fast crazy that thats safer but i can see it ||| wow definitly need to look into switching into that technology ||| same here! it has been great talking to you! bye ||| im doing great! what did you think about what we read? ||| yeah i think alot of people dont really think about it ||| same here it was only recently i found out the difference between expiration and use by date ||| no im a walmart and aldi type of person ||| oh i have been wanting to shop at a lidl ive heard great things!

||| yes some just for recipe ideas ||| i think so i want to inform people of what a problem this is ||| bye! ||| I feellike ive become so desensitized its just every month now ||| it is very sad I think we need to take a look at fixing other aspects then availability of guns ||| true just the guy with the gun which is good I guess ||| Me two he was pretty old I wonder if it was his for a while ||| Yeah true but you can walk the street in my city and buy one its crazy ||| I am on the borderline so I know from the news those things happen alot ||| oh okay Ive sadly grown up with columbine, sandy hook then so on every year I wish more mental health was available to the people and kids doing this ||| wow that sounds like a way better time to live in ||| I agree your shielded from the bad stuff ||| Me two they said it didnt have to do with the election but it was near there and he was hispanic ||| you two bye ||| hey what did you think about the article ||| I agree I wish I knew more of motivation ||| True it is such an odd occurance ||| Yeah we don't need that kind of person running around society ||| true alot of tax dollars go to horrible people in prison ||| Me two! i can barely afford it ||| Really that makes me so angry! ||| how is that possible ! ||| Yeah true I just got fulltime i had no idea ||| I agree, have to go great chatting bye ||| I know how could this type of thing happen! ||| i think mental health makes you do crazy things tho ||| that plus the kids health issue just probably didnt take time to decompress ||| I agree and she was so young when they married i think it was probable theyd grow apart ||| yes agreed it seems so much and then he was probably insecure and controlling as she was pretty and young they were not happy, cant believe it end in killing tho ||| Agreed, they should have had better communication and resolved things civilly if only she could have had resources to help her get away she probably felt trapped ||| maybe he wanted them all to be together forever ind of thinking ||| oh true ive seen other stories with that mindset ||| oh i followed that it so was so especially the way he disposed of them like they were garbage chilling ||| yes like your conscious is just turned off i dont now how that happens ||| Oh my gosh really what a coincidence! ||| yeah that is very odd i would be worried two haha ||| yup never now people until your behind closed doors ||| yeah people are narcassists and master manipulators to fool people ||| me two ! well this was a great conversation thanks! ||| I agree I cant imagine ||| I agree she just needed a little help ||| Me niether men never can share there emotions and this happens ||| Yes and then lines get crossed, I cant imagine a father or husband hurting there family how ||| I always am afraid this will happen to me, I would not know what to do but be stuck ||| Those are the scariest kind of people ||| more counselorsshould be around ||| yes resources for both sides of it ||| Something will get worse and it finally will ||| I agree its been nice talking bye ||| what are your thoughts about the water ||| same it is scary we are suppose to be protected not lied to by the government ||| yeah i thought that was fixed when the media coverage went away i guess not ||| yeah i agree i thought some celebrities were doing alot in the beggining its crazy ||| Only at my families cottage the water was all the lake water so we needed bottled water ||| oh yeah just wasn'tthe cleanest but no harm would come ||| oh is that safe water? ||| oh that seems super helpful but i cant imagine not having the convenience of drinking from the tap ||| poor kids who knows the damage its done to them already ||| wow I did not know that why is this not more monitored! ||| you two bye! ||| I think it is so scary ||| I agree it is scary how much is hidden from us ||| I agree especially after flint ! ||| I know isnt that scary just poison in our waters no coverage of it ||| im am so freaked out! ||| glad i get bottled water ||| one day it will be fixed ||| yeah horrible quality of life ||| They need fema or something ||| it has been great chatting! bye ||| I think he needs to be overthrown ||| yes, the scary dictator ||| I think it was all a hit job ||| Putin has done so many hits against epople that trade i wouldnt be suprised ||| something needs to be done so hes not in power anymore ||| an assacination no way hell relinquish power, and anyone in russia is to afraid to go against him ||| They need to over throw him have a revolution ||| He would have them killed is the issue ||| crazy theres still evil dictators in 2019 ||| need to just kill them and move on ||| it was nice chatting bye"
p069,"This is a very bad tragic all the people that that was on that train died families was lost cause of this. I know how the mother's fathers aunt sisters etc... must feel to lose there loved ones to never kiss them goodnight. Husband and wife split apart cause this wreck and for the survivors, I know they must have been scared after this happen my heart goes out to everyone affected.",It was sad time all the people that was lost ||| I didn't know that what was that crash about ||| yeah i hate stories like this such a tragic event to lose someone. ||| I know i heard one crash happen cause the train conduter was under the influence of drugs. I just wish people could not do that with other peoples lives. ||| Wow that crazy i know we all love our jobs but these bosses should be fired they killed lots of people doing this. ||| Humans is slowly killing each other this way.One day they be just robots doing these train jobs even know they can screw up but not this badly i don't think. ||| Yes can't be any worse then what us human do. Sucks jobs will be lost but if it brings better safety i will take it. ||| Yeah till we decide to destory robots then they try to kill us lol ||| Yeah but it's always possible look at what happen to area 51 all them people actually went. I wasn't excepting that but they failed lol they was like 20miles from the gate. ||| I read they went but acting like clowns. But i heard the real gate to 51 after the first gate is 20miles pretty sure no one going run for 20miles to get shredded. ||| All they need is just a tank and before the people get there they go flying into the air one tank is enough no need to waste bullets ||| bye
p070,"China's first female fighter pilot died in an aerobatics crash. I wonder if she would have ever seen any other flight than performing in shows. I've definitely got mixed feelings about this. On the one hand she's definitely a trailblazer for women in her country. On the other hand, for what purpose? ||| Why do high rises not have a limit on the amount a window can be opened? I understand if you don't have air conditioning it might need to be wide, but why can't we have limits so that a small body can't fall out? It's a terrible thing, and one I'm sure the parents never even considered. Alternative to that I suppose you'd have to not have anything at all a child could climb up to the window on. It's just too sad though, because you would need to not even have a stool - at two, a kid could certainly move one of those.","I'm of two minds about this article. On the one hand, yay first female fighter pilot in China. On the other, she was flying in aerobatic shows. Is that really groundbreaking? ||| Do you think she would have ever seen combat? Or at least flown for their military? ||| There are three other remaining female pilots I think. I wonder if this will impact their service. ||| I believe so. I was just reading about how women were excluded from the space program in the 60s even though they were physically more able to withstand the forces on their bodies ||| I do wonder what went wrong. I also wonder if the people who think women should be kept out of the military would use this as a way to justify their views. ||| Now that's an interesting thought. You mean some sort of sabotage? ||| Then my biggest question would be about her male copilot - since he ejected safely, would it be possible he had something to do with it? ||| I guess that's a good possibility, especiallly when you think about all fo the people who were saying that this is proof women can't be fighter pilots ||| It's also very easy to think that if there was sabotage, it's possible it would be used to create a martyr of sorts. Someone that Chinese women could look up to ||| I think I've run out of conversation about this topic and am ready to say goodbye ||| Hi, I thought the article was dreadfully sad. I can't imagine being those parents. ||| I do wonder though why limits on how far you can open a window in a high rise isn't a thing. The one time I lived in a high rise you couldn't open the windows more than a few inches. ||| Do you know of any child proofing things for windows? The only think I could think of would prevent the windows from being opened ||| True. I wonder if the parents will eventually feel moved to try and get bars installed. It sounds like the kind of situation where it could easily happen again ||| I mean, it seems like it might be a potential legal issue - or osha or something. Then again, I'm also remembering the recent cruise where a baby/kid fell several stories out of a window ||| Me too. I know some people hate safety laws, but it seems like this one area should be a safety thing. I mean, for the owners of high rises to take reasonable precautions against people going out windows. If you think about it, it could also apply to an adult! ||| That's really what I meant about legal issue before - I mean, not for the parents but for the owners. ||| I am grateful though that the parents aren't being looked at with suspicion. It seems all too often that there might be something else going on. ||| If it was me, I'm not sure I'd be abe to live above ground level ever again ||| goodbye"
p071,"I just read an article about recent tragedies that have taken place on the island of hati. It talked about a hurricane and then the earthquake that happend their. Both were awful, terrible events. Many people were dis placed and chaos ensued. This was because many homes were destroyed and people did not have the chance to settle down after these disasters","I am not sure it is a quite poor area :( ||| I think if the UN is able to get them the required funds that will help a lot. ||| Yes, I hear there is a lot of corruption there as well, that is also a problem. Money is short term ||| Yes getting a better government is the best way to help any region. Most countries, do not absolutely need outside for every disaster ||| Yes two things can be true at once though. They want a better government but also try to get power and control in the process. ||| Yeah I would not count on it. So you think the change should come from within? ||| Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this. ||| Yeah but you can not have it both ways, either we send money and get power and control, or we send it no strings attached. So I think there might have to be strings actually, as you reminded me of the corruption. ||| I think the article said the UN was looking to send $800 million. No more then ten years in my opinion ||| Yes there will always be disasters. Until the core problem of the country is fixed, I think we will always have to be ready to help. ||| Yes I think if we could supply them advisers and disaster professionals they could greatly benefit ||| I probably would not. We would have to compensate those individuals well. ||| Yeah but I think the fact they would be helping those in need, could also be a motivation ||| Probably different for each person, I am optimistic though. ||| Yes this has been enjoyable. bye"
p072,"I feel very bad for this person. I know I have seen people go through cancer and it is always sad as it just seems to tear them apart so quickly. This person is clearly strong and has an abundance of support so I wish them the best in their fight. Besides that, I wish they can find a cure for this soon. ","I thought it was very sad but also kind of uplifting ||| It happens all the time which is crazy ||| Yeah, I can see that. It also just seems to diminish their health really fast ||| Whenever I see these stories, I always wonder is there is a cure to be found ||| The whole ordeal must be very painful, Chemo has so many adverse affects. ||| That sounds rough. Not sure how people deal with it for years. ||| Yeah, I would not blame anyone who decides to take euthanasia ||| I get that, but also some like pancreatic I hear have less than a 5% survival rate. ||| Extremely as one can only imagine ||| I would certainly breakdown if my spouse went through that ||| Yeah and all the hospital visits must just add to the stress ||| Yeah, and all the bills can stack up quick ||| All hospital visits are absurdly expensive ||| Yeah, and insurance can also be shady too ||| Yeah and the answer machine is always a pain. Also the number of callers ahead of me. ||| Alright, goodbye"
p073,"That is so sad what happened to the people at the concert. I can't imagine why someone would want to do something like that. What would they get from it? I feel so badly for the families involved. It was over 100 people. It is just so sad. It's nice what they are doing with the concerts now, but nothing will bring those people's family members back. ||| This story is sad because of all the frogs becoming sick and how quickly it is spreading. I think that maybe the areas where this is happening can try to educate people on what they can do to try to keep the disease from spreading any further. Most people probably don't even realize that their garden ponds might be causing this disease for the frogs. ||| I just read this story about a female lawyer that is accusing Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her in 1999. He apparently tried to get her to sit next to him, cleared a space at the table next to him, and touched her butt. It's hard for me to really know with these stories because so much of it seems to be influenced by politics. ||| This is a sad story about all of the people trying to flee Syria. It said that 1 out of every 50 people in the country have been killed due to war. I can't imagine living and trying to raise a family in this sort of situation. These people are obviously risking their lives trying to get out but they are also risking their lives staying. ||| This is a terrible story about an ISIS attack in Paris. It was at a concert and went on for hours. 90 people were killed. I feel so badly for the people who lost loved ones in the attack and for the people who had to go through it but survived. I can't imagine that life for them will ever be the same. ||| This article is about Afghans that are moving back around Afghanistan and really are having a hard time finding anywhere safe and good to live. Some of them have moved to other places but are not able to be successful there and are moving back to Afghanistan even with fighting happening there. I feel so sad for anyone who has to live like this. ||| This is so sad. I can't even imagine living and trying to raise my family in a situation like this. These poor people can't even send their kids to school because they have to get up so early and stand in food lines. Or else the kids are too weak and sick from not eating, they can't go to school. Also, the school supplies are so expensive, they can't buy them because they need to buy food. ||| This is a sad story about one wolf who was being tracked and had traveled more than 700 miles. It was shot and killed in Montana by a sniper. I'm not real sure of the reason for the killing because the article said that it is part of a federal program. I feel bad for the wolf but am not real clear on if the program is necessary or not. ||| This news story is about how more and more kids are overdosing on opioids. They are finding in laying around their house or figuring out how to open bottles. Most of the cases are from parents in the home having prescriptions for the opioid. I think this is so sad and is part of a larger problem of opioid addiction. ||| This is so sad. I hadn't heard of this happening, but US strikes in Afghanistan ended up killing many civilians. One of the strikes actually hit an emergency hospital that Doctors without Borders was operating. A lot of the patients and the staff were killed. It just sounds horrible. Relatives were trying to walk through the streets with the bodies of their dead children. I can't even imagine what it would be like for these people. ||| I can't imagine living in Saudi Arabia as a woman. I really can't understand how it must feel. The article said that sometimes women will have to get permission to do things like travel or work from their own son. That just seems crazy. I am totally behind these women who are fighting to end the male guardianship program.  ||| This is a story about a 12 year old girl in Russia who killed herself after spending time online with a group that promotes suicide. I feel so badly for the family and for the girl. A group like that should not be able to operate online and influence people to harm themselves. This is just so wrong.  ||| This article really makes you think. Are the things we are doing to try to make the earth a healthier planet really helping? They are trying to make cleaner energy but in reality, they are killing off many birds. This is so sad, it's a catch 22. It seems that these wind energy generators are probably not the answer either. And the more that are made, it will just cause bigger problems. ||| This is a very sad situation. I can see both sides are trying to do something good, but just have different values. The Native Americans really deserve to keep their land and their resources. Maybe the people that are building the oil pipeline can figure out a way to do it that will not interfere with the Native American's lives. ||| I feel so badly for this lady's family. They may not even realize that she is missing at the time of the article, but I'm sure they are already realizing that she is having problems with her memory. I have seen many family members with Alzheimer's, including my dad, and it is horrible to watch and to deal with. ||| This is a horrific story. It is about islamic militants capturing villagers and using them as human shields. The villagers didn't have much, if any, of a choice to go with them. They also killed most of the police and army so the villagers had no one to protect them. It is absolutely horrifying for these people. ||| This article is about a mission where American military were helping to train Afghan military targeting Taliban leaders. In the attack that was instructed by the American troops, Afghan civilians were killed. It was obviously not something that anyone wanted to happen, but when fighting erupted, innocent people were killed. ||| This story is very unimaginable. This guy was adopted from South Korea and came to the US when he was three. He has had a really hard life over the years being abandoned by his adoptive parents and put into the foster system, where he was treated very poorly. Now he is being deported because his adoptive parents never filled out any paperwork and he was too old when an act was passed to protect people like him. ||| This is a sad story about a predominantly Muslim community in Burma that is fighting with the government and military of the region. They are under constant fear of attack. There are roadblocks so they can't get food in or get out to get food. The prices of goods that are within the area have also risen drastically. I can't imagine having to live in this type of situation. ||| This is a story about a young boy who was helping his father in the fields and fell down a well. It was too narrow for an adult to go down so it took them four days to get to him. When they found him, he was dead. This is horrifying. I can't imagine how this boy felt being stuck in the well and how his family felt while trying to get to him. ||| This article was about gender gaps worldwide and especially in the US. It said that the gender gap in the United States is getting worse and is 45th in the rankings. The article didn't say anything about why the gender gap might be getting worse, like possibly more women wanting to stay home and raise families. ||| This is an article about wildlife dying in Paraguay because of drought and mismanagement of the water resources. The area doesn't get water year round so they have to find ways to save water for the dry months. The dry area is between Argentina and Paraguay and currently Argentina has figured out ways to make the water last for them and is essentially taking the water and leaving the other side dry. I think it's sad and scary for the wildlife in the area.","What did you think of the article? ||| I just feel so badly for the families of all those people killed. ||| And for what reason? I just can't figure it out. ||| No, that's a big problem. It's nice that Sting had a concert and a moment of silence. ||| I'm sure so many people want to help and do something, but I really don't know if there is anything that will make the hurt go away for the families. ||| Sadly, it probably will. ||| I just can't understand how anyone would want to do something like this. ||| I think it's really scary when people for some reason think that killing other people is a good thing. Then what will stop them? ||| They were also holding people hostage, I can't imagine the terror. ||| Or waiting to see if your loved one is one of the ones that was killed or is safe? ||| This is so depressing ||| I have never liked crowds, but I do think I tend to stay away from large events more since so many things have been happening. Does it bother you? ||| That's super scary too. This whole world is scary. I worry all the time about my kids at school too. I try to teach them to be nice to everyone and talk to the kids that other people pick on. Hopefully, they can spread a little bit of kindness and help if someone is feeling so isolated that they would do something like that. ||| It's crazy what people write to each other in comment sections. ||| People are very close minded. ||| It's been good talking to you! ||| I hope you have  good day ||| bye ||| I can't even imagine having to live like that as a woman. I support the women who are trying to get rid of the program. ||| I seriously think I would be jailed or murdered if I lived there. I couldn't do it. And sometimes they have to ask their own son for permission. ||| I know, and I wonder what age the son is old enough to make the decisions. I bet it's pretty yound. ||| It's unreal. I hope that these women are able to change something, but probably even if the system is ended, they will still be treated the same way by their families. ||| I agree, it will probably take a very long time, but I guess change has to start somewhere. ||| Reading this article, I feel as a woman that I am very fortunate. ||| I like to think that I wouldn't, but I think sometimes controlling people don't really show themselves at first. What about you? ||| That's good. I'm sure if I found myself with a controlling partner, it would not last long! ||| Yeah, I hope so too! It's been nice chatting with you! ||| bye ||| Yeah, this is so scary and sad. ||| If they could keep these types of websites shut down. This girl probably wouldn't have done it if she hadn't been exposed to so much online. A 12 year old really isn't thinking it through. ||| Yeah, but I can also see kids that aren't even depressed, getting immersed in the online community and deciding it would be cool or somehow make them famous. ||| I think her parents would have at least had a chance to try to do something. It sounds like they had no idea. What do you think? ||| Yeah, I agree. Any story like this is so sad. I can't believe that children this young are ever committing suicide. It's just so sad. ||| When my kids were that young I would have never thought that they might be considering such a thing. I feel so bad for any parent that has to deal with it. I can't imagine living after. ||| That's what I was wondering too. Why would you want to convince people to commit suicide? Maybe they are sociopathic and just get a kick out of it, which is utterly disgusting. ||| It's really gross. ||| Yeah, me too! It's been good chatting with you! bye ||| yeah, really makes you wonder ||| If what we are doing is really improving life on earth ||| Yeah, but are the wind energy generators something that should be used or not? And there are not that many yet. Have you ever seen areas where they are? ||| I'm thinking of the fields of giant windmills. I see them sometimes when I am driving in rural areas. They are massive and each area has many windmills. It seems that they go on for miles. I can't imagine being a bird and trying to navigate that. ||| It just really makes you wonder, when we look back on technologies, will we have done the right thing or did we end up damaging the earth more in our efforts to help. ||| Yeah, it's been a relatively short time that humans have been living on the earth in civilized societies. I can't imagine how long we can continue this without destroying everything. ||| A lot of people probably don't think that way. They just have to have all of the latest and greatest and don't really think about how future generations are going to suffer. ||| You are right. It would be impossible to live in this society without using these things. ||| I guess that's true, but the bird doesn't have the knowledge that we do. Maybe they can just figure out a way to put giant cages around the windmills or something so that the birds can't fly into the fans. ||| Yeah, that would be a good idea. ||| I'm just trying to look for a little positive. Maybe we can figure out a way to all live happily! ||| bye ||| I completely agree with you, neither side is purposefully trying to hurt the other. It seems that the oil people would have more resources to figure something out than the Native Americans. ||| I just think that they might be able to figure something out. They probably have a lot more resources and money. ||| I feel horribly for the Native Americans though. This seems to really be threatening their way of life. ||| Yeah, like the MAGA hat kid story ||| Totally agreed! And I had not read the article closely enough. I thought the Native Americans were protesting themselves. I didn't realize they were there with the environmental activists. ||| If that is the case though, even more sad for the Native Americans that are being used by the activists and getting hurt in the protests. ||| So true. ||| If there is a way to do it and avoid going through that land, that might be the best thing to do. ||| I would think the protests might have them thinking a little about it at least. But I think it said the land was owned by the federal government, but the Native Americans thought they had some right to it because of some treaty. ||| That makes sense. It seems that there should be a way to make it safe so that the Native Americans are ok with it. And it could help them get jobs too. ||| That is a great idea! ||| It's been great talking to you! ||| bye! ||| Sad story for these frogs :( ||| I wonder if the general public has been told anything about what they can do to stop the spread of the disease. ||| I would think most people with garden ponds wouldn't want to endanger the frogs if they knew about it ||| Yeah, and if it's being spread by whatever they are getting from aquatic stores, the stores should have to test before they sell anything ||| They said that the garden ponds could act like stepping stones, but they aren't discouraging people from having them so I wonder if they think there is a way to stop it. ||| Maybe some type of antivirus to add to their ponds? ||| Yeah, like some type of bait ||| Even if there was something for homeowners to do to stop it at their own ponds, then it would be harder for the virus to spread ||| I agree, the community would all have to work together! ||| Yes, if it's going to protect the frogs and fish and whatever other wildlife will eventually be affected. ||| Yeah, it's crazy how the loss of one species in an environment can totally throw off the whole ecosystem. ||| It's been nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| goodbye ||| Hello! How do you feel about this story? ||| I agree, who knows if it really happened or if this is just political. ||| Exactly, the timing is always very suspicious. ||| Yeah, I can see that too. But it's not like Clarence Thomas just became a big thing recently. ||| I think these things must really bother people who have been actually attacked / raped... She says he cupped his hand over her butt. If that happened to me, I would probably forget about it by the next day. ||| If women and men are completely equal. I think men wouldn't really think twice about a women touching their butt. And I don't think 20 that they would be going public about it 20 years later. ||| Too funny! If he did intentionally cup his hand over her butt 20 years ago, would there be anything legally to do about it anyway? ||| The world is a scary place. I feel for my kids having to grow up in this environment. ||| That's a good way to look at it! ||| I think about that all of the time. When you do look at how much it's changed from even just 200 years ago. I wonder how long it can keep going. ||| Yeah, who knows. I can't imagine the future progressing as quickly as it has over the past 100 years. ||| Great conversation! Went from butt touching to the end of technological revolution! Nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| I was thinking about that, but if she still lives by herself, they might not have realized that she was gone yet. ||| I don't recall an exact time but it seemed that it was recent that she had been found. ||| Yeah, Alzheimer's runs badly in my dad's family and he is starting to show signs of it. I worry about something like this happening all of the time. ||| So sorry. I keep hearing that they are so close to a cure. I hope so! ||| I just remembered the story said she was wearing scrub pants. That sounds like she was in a facility. If so, that is horrible if they haven't realized that she is missing. ||| I wonder if they noticed she was missing but didn't want to tell the police. ||| That would be sad. I've seen too many stories of facilities covering things up to save their reputation. Maybe they thought she would wander and then eventually return. ||| It is so sad, I'm sure it would be hard enough just to make the decision to put someone in a facility, and then to have to deal with this kind of thing. ||| bye ||| This story is so sad. I can't imagine trying to live like that. ||| I guess risking your life to leave would be worth it when you are already living in such a dangerous area. ||| I wonder how this situation is now. The article said Obama was president at the time. It said 1 out of every 50 people in the country had been killed at that time. ||| Hopefully it's better! ||| It really makes me thankful that I can live somewhere that I am not constantly in fear of my life. I just feel so horribly for anyone that has to live in that type of situation. ||| Yeah, and to be a parent of a small child, to see their innocence and want to protect that for them. ||| If I was in that situation I would try to leave too. ||| That would be best. I can't imagine having to leave whatever you have and go to a new country and start from nothing. ||| Actually thinking about it that way, I don't know if I would have the courage to leave. ||| Maybe, but it would be really scary. I can't imagine having to start a completely new life in a new country. The people that do leave must be very strong people! ||| True, I guess it's choosing the best between two not great things. ||| True ||| Me too. It's been good talking to you! ||| bye ||| bye ||| This story is horrible. ||| I know, very hard to read. I can't even imagine having to live through it. ||| Exactly, and I read it buy it was like looking at something and trying so hard not to see it. ||| No one should have to find something like that out on social media, but I don't think anyway of finding that out would be horrible. ||| Also, the people that survived it. I think it said it went on for 3 hours, hearing shooting. I can't imagine life ever being normal again after that. ||| Yeah me too, I didn't realize how long it lasted. ||| Hopefully the survivors were able to get help. ||| It sounded like there were lots of things done in the city to support the victims and survivors, but that probably only helps for a short time. ||| I know, I wonder to. It may help some people, but some people are probably annoyed by it. It's kind of like how my brother died from cancer and I hate all of the cancer t-shirts and ribbons and stuff. I feel like its celebrating cancer. ||| I think that's exactly what it is. ||| I'm sure seeing the amount of people that come out for a benefit or maybe send a note or whatever, I'm sure it helps the people a lot. But at the end of the day, that is all gone, and that is probably the most hard time. ||| you too, bye ||| I can't imagine not helping in this situation. It is absolutely horrifying. ||| I know, over 90% of the people in the village had been kidnapped. ||| And for the people that are walking, being used as human shields. One mother was pushing her disabled son in a wheelchair. ||| Yeah, it's hard to believe that this kind of thing is happening in the world today. ||| Or if it will ever be stable. ||| Hopefully it's moving in the right direction, but if things like this story are still happening, it is very far from being stable. ||| That's true. Love the optimism! ||| I would think at this point airstrikes would be hard since they have all of the civilians with them. I guess if they are targeting something that is distant to them but would cause them to release the people. ||| If they could somehow get the villagers away and then attack, but I don't know how they could do that. Maybe since the villagers are walking in front of the militants, they could get to them first, get them to safety and then go after the militants. ||| I just hope that something can be figured out to help those people. ||| you too! bye ||| What did you think about this article? ||| Yeah, it's really sad for them. And I never considered that people that had previously fled would then go back. ||| I agree, I hope that is stays this way in America for many years also. ||| Can you imagine just leaving everything you have and going to another country where you might not even speak the language to start a new life? And what if you had children? I feel so badly for anyone in a situation like that. ||| I think those people must be very brave. But I guess it also depends on how bad the situation is that you are living in. ||| Yeah, it didn't seem from the article that they were getting much help though. ||| I agree, those organizations exist, I just can't remember reading anything in the article about any help or hope for those people. It sounded more like the countries that they had fled to weren't doing much for them and were encouraging them to return to Afghanistan. ||| I thought it also sounded like some people decided to go back on their own because they felt they could be more successful there even if they had to deal with the danger. ||| I can't imagine making that decision myself, but maybe they are just trying to survive and make a living. ||| It's been nice chatting with you! ||| You too! bye ||| Wow, this story really makes me appreciate the little things. ||| Yeah, and no matter how good of intentions the parents may have, they are just stuck in a terrible situation. ||| But even if that was the case there, the kids aren't even able to get to school sometimes because they have to go stand in food lines to get food for the entire family. It's a vicious circle because they are being kept out of school so they are not getting the education that they need to eventually be able to have a better life. ||| It is all just really sad, obviously everyone there must be very hungry. I would think most people would try make sure their kids were getting food before they ate it themselves. ||| It makes me so sad, sometimes I think I wish I could just send money to people like this but I don't really know how or if I trust organizations. What my family spends on one meal eating out would probably be life changing for people like this. ||| I just can't imagine living somewhere like that and trying to raise my children and give them the life they deserve. ||| Same here, but even sometimes I wonder \Have I given them everything they need?\"""" ||| Yes, this story definitely makes you realize how good we have it. ||| You're so right, these hits make me so sad all of the time. And if you watch our news, sometimes it seems like they are saying that our country is so terrible. If people paid more attention to what is actually happening all over the world, maybe they would realize how good we have it. ||| Yeah, you really have to go outside of the mainstream media to find much that is just about our country and our politics. I love watching documentaries on different cultures and issues occurring around the world. ||| It's been great talking to you! ||| bye ||| No, it ||| Sorry, I accidentally hit enter before. I think you're right, and the people that you are fighting for are more likely to turn against you too. ||| And I think it was supposed to be a training mission for Afghan forces, which seems like a complete failure. ||| Definitely, the civilians were probably not being harmed as much by the Taliban. Their main enemy is probably the people fighting against the Taliban. ||| I think people mainly care about themselves. ||| I can see both ways. I can see how it can cause problems being there for too long, but also leaving the area might allow problems to rise back up. ||| I wish I could believe that. Why do you think nothing like that will happen again? ||| I would hope so, but I think the terrorists are constantly trying to think of new ways to commit terror, even biological and chemical attacks. ||| I appreciate your optimism! It makes me feel a little better. ||| That's what makes me still worried about terrorist attacks, because when you see what some of these kids do and no one can stop them, I don't see how we can stop terrorist groups that have much more capabilities and access to weapons. ||| I just feel that in most of the instances, home or terrorist, our government is always reacting, like remove your shoes at the airport because there was a shoe bomber. Or the kid had a lot of signs that he was going to do something but we couldn't do anything because he hadn't committed a crime yet. ||| I am too, but if restricting my freedoms is keeping myself and my family safe, I can tolerate some to a point. ||| Sorry! Maybe we just met somewhere in the middle! It's been nice talking to you. ||| bye ||| How do you feel about this article? ||| Yeah, I agree, especially after the poor guy traveled over 700 miles. He had no idea what he was heading into. ||| I wonder why there is a federal program to kill the wolves. ||| Yeah, that makes sense. I still don't even like to think about it. ||| He was probably run out of other areas by other wolves claiming the territory. It is so sad, his fears were probably of other male wolves. ||| Yeah, it's really hard to think about though, because you can also feel for the animals that the wolves are killing. And if they don't kill any of the wolves, they may become even a bigger threat. It seems animals are being hurt either way. ||| I wonder if people can legally kill them there. It might be better if the government controls it all than putting it in the hands of the ranchers. ||| I feel like when I'm watching a nature show and everything is nice and all the animals are fine and then some predator comes in and tries to catch one of the animals. I understand it has to happen, but I don't want to see it or even think about it. ||| Well hopefully you can forget about this and have a great day! ||| Nice talking to you! ||| bye ||| It's unbelievable. The poor guy hasn't gotten any breaks. ||| He has just been failed by so many people. It's very sad. And now he has to go live in North Korea? He probably can't even read or speak their language. ||| Yeah, I realized that right after I sent it. Either way though, he is being dropped into a completely foreign culture / language. ||| I totally agree, it seems that newer situations like this will be covered by the Child Citizenship Act, but he was already over 18 at that time so he didn't qualify. ||| He probably is hoping to just figure a way to get back to the U.S. to his family. ||| I think in the article they were asking people to call their Congress person and try to get it fixed. Not sure if it's too late for him though. ||| I agree. I doubt that anyone would be against this guy staying in the country. I think it's just a very unfortunate situation. ||| Sadly, you are probably right. I just feel so sad for this guy, to think of him as a toddler being sent to America to be adopted with a bright future. And then for nothing to ever go good for him. It's just too sad. He may not have that criminal history if he had been taken in by loving parents. ||| These stories are so depressing. ||| You're right, I remember when I was younger seeing feel good stories all of the time on the news. Now it all seems to be negative. ||| bye ||| Yeah, I didn't find the article really informative. I thought it was a bit confusing. ||| I agree, I can't imagine living the life that they are trying to live under those conditions. ||| Wow, you are really knowledgeable about this. I feel bad I didn't even realize this was going on. ||| I completely agree with you on that. If people were more aware of how people are living in other parts of the world, they may realize that the United States is actually a great country to be living in at this time. ||| Yes, exactly. These Rohingya Muslims probably aren't sitting around worried about plastic straws and thinking of ways to shoot up their classmates. ||| I'm sure they don't. They are barely able to get food. I can't even imagine what it would be like to live there and try to protect my family. ||| I think it must be a very complex situation, or else a solution would have been already found. ||| They probably don't care if they die. What do you think? ||| Yeah, I don't really get from the article, like you said, what the reasoning behind all of this is. ||| You too! bye ||| It's horrible. I can ||| Yeah, that's what I was going to say but I accidentally hit enter. I can't imagine what he went through and his family. It sounds horrible, but I hope for him that he died quickly and wasn't in the well scared for days. ||| Me too, but I am kind of grateful the article didn't give a lot of details. It's just terrifying. ||| I wonder if his dad knew that the well was there. He probably feels so guilty either way since the boy was helping him when it happened. ||| I don't think it said how old the boy was either. I thought it just said young. ||| Really, I'm having a hard time discussing this story because it's just too hard to think about. It is just so sad. I can't imagine if this happened to one of my children. ||| I know, it's heart wrenching. ||| That's true, I'm sure they probably worked night and day. ||| Hopefully they can have peace with it. I'm sure they did all they could. ||| It's been good talking to you and thanks for trying to find some positive in the situation! ||| bye ||| I have a hard time with pay comparisons by gender. I'm not denying that women on average probably make less, I'm just not sure it's a fair comparison. ||| It's not necessarily sad. My husband and I chose for me to be a stay at home mom and for him to work. That is what works for our family. I think we are lucky to be able to have one of us stay home. ||| I really don't get what they say about that either, because while I was working, I had a job in science in genetics. At my work and at most of the other universities that we worked with, it seemed to be at least 50/50 men to women and I actually think more women. ||| I think possibly there are more men who are engineers, but I think it's just not a career choice that many women make. If a women does get an engineering degree, she will probably have an easy time getting a job because there are so few women engineers and companies are always trying to add diversity. ||| I just feel like sometimes men and women don't have to have equal representation in jobs. If a woman or a man wants to do a job that is traditionally only done by the other sex, I think they have every right to pursue that and shouldn't be discriminated against. But there are some jobs that most women or most men wouldn't be interested in. Like, I've never seen a female trash person. Most women just wouldn't be interested in that job. ||| I'm sure worldwide, that there are places where women are discriminated against horribly. I can't imagine living in a place like that. ||| I felt like the article was trying to say how bad the US is though that they have moved down in gender pay equality. I feel like if people really looked at how other cultures are, they would appreciate how good we really have it in the US. ||| Yeah, I guess it gives every country something to strive for. ||| Yes, definitely. It's been good chatting with you. ||| bye ||| This is just sad, and I think part of a much larger problem of opioid addiction. ||| Yeah, the kids are probably getting it more because it is around so much more than it used to be. ||| My kids could figure those out when they were pretty young. ||| That's a great idea! Like on a padlock. ||| Or like a combination - turn cap right to 21, then left to 12.... l ||| I wonder if the kids who overdose have any increased susceptibility to addition in the future. ||| That ||| Yeah, I accidentally hit enter. I was just going to say that is what I thought I had heard also. I guess people with children could also be more careful with their prescriptions, like not letting pills lay around or maybe keep them in a safe. ||| It seems so simple, but apparently it is not what is happening. ||| It seems crazy to me that the kids would actually ingest the pills, I would think as soon as they tasted it, it would taste so bad that they would spit it out. I guess it happens though. ||| Yeah, hopefully though they do feel bad and it doesn't happen more than once to the same child. ||| Yeah, nice talking to you! bye ||| I don't know if it is or isn't, but this seems to be effecting the population of wildlife in this area right now. It makes me so sad to think of these poor animals trying to find water. ||| It seems like it might be partly a political issue because the area forms the border of two countries, and one side is fine with water. ||| They don't care, but it seems that the two countries have to figure out a way to keep this from happening. ||| That's a good question. I guess I am naive in thinking that the countries would work together. ||| I think Paraguay, the side that is bad, is the side being accused of mismanagement. So maybe if they figure out a way to use the water better, they can help. ||| I believe in climate change. The climate has obviously changed a lot over the time the earth has existed. I don't know how much of climate changes is due to people or to natural changes. ||| I think in this situation, they are obviously having  a drought this season. I don't think one or two years of drought would necessarily signify climate change. And the larger problem is that people are taking the water for their own uses and leaving the area dry. ||| Yeah, I agree! I don't think we are going to solve it in this short conversation! ||| It's been good chatting with you! ||| bye ||| Some of these articles are so hard to read, I can't even imagine having to live like this. ||| And the civilians. There was the hospital that Doctors without Borders had that was hit on mistake. Apparently there were many civilian lives taken. ||| I know. I try to put myself in their shoes to feel what it would be like, but I can't even begin to realize what it would be like. ||| Yeah, the article said that the families were trying to parade through the streets with the bodies of their children that had died. ||| Very, this article definitely makes me realize how lucky I am to live in the US. ||| Yeah, I hope my children and grandchildren are able to have the same. ||| I hope so. I really wish that no one would have to live like the people in that article. ||| Me too, it seems that that area will never be peaceful. ||| Yeah, me too. It's been nice chatting with you! ||| bye"
p074,"The people in India are in a dilemma that's based on greed, like most things. The poorer population is suffering heavily by the country's dependence on coal. The impact of it is already severed. I'm really surprise that there is even enough of an elephant population that can cause so much trouble, but in the end it isn't their fault either. ||| This article really focused on the science side of things.
