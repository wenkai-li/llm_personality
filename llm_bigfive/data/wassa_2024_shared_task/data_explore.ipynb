      "True. but I dont believe one should be above the law ||| true but there are other forms of protest. ||| The protest itself didnt rub me the wrong way. the way the police handled it wasnt prob not the greatest esp when they shot the horse ||| I agree that it was handled in a very wrong manner, and the police officers showing up in the riot gear was interesting ||| it felt like they went there expecting a fight. ||| I wonder if it had to do with the media hype of the protest and they expected more backlash. not sure ||| Thats the truth, I mean yea, they needed to be cleared, but the aggressiveness of the round up was too much ||| That should definately be looked into as a state training. because it wasnt just one dept that rounded them up ||| I dont think its all police but there has been a uptick in fresh recruits and I think that the new recruit in this day and day are not properly trained to handle situtations ||| I agree it casts a shadow that is really hard to get out of esp. ||| Our local dept all have cameras. But I really like the fact they have live PD and things like that. But social media has made the job way harder, because you only hear 1 side of the story ||| I think the mouths of the officers on the show need to be better, but I know if a cop told me stop or be shot, I would be stopping ||| That is very true. ||| I believe its because the one time you dont, it can cost you your life. But one life is not greater than another ||| goodbye ||| Its crazy how you never truly know someone no matter how long you have been together ||| I get lovers querl but when the children. I get mad at my kids but I could never ever in a million year ever think to physcially harm or mame or kill them. ||| Do you think the fact that you have to work basically 2 full time jobs to survive resulted in his mental health/ ||| Its really hard when you have to be the rock and hold it together for everyone else but never ae allowed the chance to break down or have a repreieve ||| I agree, as I am a result of a young marriage due to pregnancy that resulted in divorce, she was not allowed to live before having to grow up and being responsible for another person ||| I tell my husband, if you are unhappy, walk away. If I am no longer making you happy I wont stop you . I couldnt imagine him or I attacking each other and ending in murder/suicide. ||| But I still do not understand the killing of the children. It makes no sense. They did nothing wrong ||| Probally, or If I cant have you your mom cant either. You never know when it comes to these type of things ||| It reminds me of the recent killings where he killed his wife who was pregnant and 2 children but he claimed they went missing. while it wasnt a murder suicide, its the same mind set ||| How can you claim to love someone so much only to 1 murder them, and 2 treat them after death like they were nothing. the sign of a mental illness for sure ||| Theres no way you can claim that you had no control over yourself when you have to physically take the life from not 1 but 4 total ppl ( Mark short) its scary to think about because the person in the article shares the name of my kids principal ||| He doesnt have any kids but man I had to reread the name a few times. Its not a super common name. ||| I have gotten to know him pretty well but  you never really know someone. Look at all the news with teachers having relations with students, ect. The person you think you know is just the person they want you to see. ||| Even behind closed doors, they have to let you in and \\trust\\\" you but you can still be fooled\" ||| I wish there was more to help those who need it ||| bye\n"
