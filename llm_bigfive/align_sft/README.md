Yes, it is possible to have two negative examples corresponding to each training example in the DPO (Distillation Policy Optimization) finetuning. When incorporating two negative examples, the loss function and the implementation will need to be adjusted accordingly.

### Loss Design

Typically, the loss in DPO with one negative example is designed to increase the preference of the positive example over the negative one. When you have two negative examples, the loss function can be adjusted to compare the positive example with both negative examples simultaneously.

#### Cross-Entropy Loss with Two Negatives

Let's denote:
- $ x^+ $ as the positive example.
- $ x_1^- $ as the first negative example.
- $ x_2^- $ as the second negative example.
- $ p(x) $ as the probability assigned by the model to example $ x $.

The objective can be to maximize the probability of $ x^+ $ while minimizing the probabilities of $ x_1^- $ and $ x_2^- $. The modified cross-entropy loss could look like this:

$$ L = -\log \left( \frac{e^{p(x^+)}}{e^{p(x^+)} + e^{p(x_1^-)} + e^{p(x_2^-)}} \right) $$

This formulation ensures that the model learns to distinguish the positive example from both negative examples.

### Implementation Changes in Huggingface Trainer

To implement this in Huggingface Trainer, you need to modify the data loading, the forward pass, and the loss calculation. Here's an outline of the necessary steps:

1. **Modify Data Collation**: Ensure that the data loader returns a tuple of (positive_example, negative_example_1, negative_example_2).

2. **Modify Forward Pass**: Adapt the forward pass to handle two negative examples and compute the logits for each example.

3. **Modify Loss Calculation**: Implement the custom loss function that takes into account the two negative examples.

Here's a simplified example of what the changes might look like in the Huggingface Trainer:

#### Custom Data Collator
```python
class CustomDataCollator:
    def __call__(self, batch):
        positive_examples = [item['positive'] for item in batch]
        negative_examples_1 = [item['negative1'] for item in batch]
        negative_examples_2 = [item['negative2'] for item in batch]
        
        return {
            'positive_examples': positive_examples,
            'negative_examples_1': negative_examples_1,
            'negative_examples_2': negative_examples_2
        }
```

#### Custom Training Loop
```python
from transformers import Trainer

class CustomTrainer(Trainer):
    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs):
        positive_examples = inputs['positive_examples']
        negative_examples_1 = inputs['negative_examples_1']
        negative_examples_2 = inputs['negative_examples_2']
        
        positive_logits = model(**positive_examples).logits
        negative_logits_1 = model(**negative_examples_1).logits
        negative_logits_2 = model(**negative_examples_2).logits
        
        # Calculate the probabilities
        positive_probs = torch.exp(positive_logits)
        negative_probs_1 = torch.exp(negative_logits_1)
        negative_probs_2 = torch.exp(negative_logits_2)
        
        # Cross-entropy loss with two negatives
        loss = -torch.log(positive_probs / (positive_probs + negative_probs_1 + negative_probs_2)).mean()
        
        return loss
```

In this implementation, you adjust the `compute_loss` method to handle two sets of negative examples and modify the loss calculation accordingly. Make sure your data loader and collator are structured to provide the required input format.

### Summary

In summary, extending DPO to include two negative examples per training example involves modifying the loss function to compare the positive example against both negative examples simultaneously. The implementation in the Huggingface Trainer requires adjustments to the data collator and the loss computation within the training loop. This ensures that the model learns to prefer the positive example over both negative examples effectively.
