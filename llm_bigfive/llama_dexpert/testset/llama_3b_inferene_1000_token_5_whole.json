You might be the type of person who values harmony and understanding, and is willing to listen to others and find common ground. In the context of Tomb Raider, this could mean you're able to form strong bonds with your allies, like Winston and Zip, and even find ways to connect with your enemies, like Natla or Trinity.\n\nYour low Neuroticism score suggests you're relatively calm, resilient, and able to handle stress and uncertainty.
