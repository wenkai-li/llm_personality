Both books have left me feeling like I've been on a wild ride, exploring the complexities of human nature and the consequences of playing with fire when it comes to technology. 'Altered Carbon' had me hooked from the get-go, with its gritty and thought-provoking take on a world where human consciousness can be transferred into new bodies.
